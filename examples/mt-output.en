Deceiving Broker Ventured Billions due to Inferiority Complex
A perfidious embezzler .
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale , the owner of the local Komerční banka ( Commerce Bank ) , labels its ex-employee Jerome Kerviel .
On his account it has lost almost five billion Euro .
More likely , it seems that Kerviel was just a big gambler who wanted to match his colleagues , and , moreover , definitely not an unqualified one .
Unlike all the big banking houses , he recognized the crisis at the American mortgage market in time .
" He is psychologically weak , " were the words of his superiors , who directed the police to him .
But , as follows from Kerviel 's testimony , which has been published by French media , e.g. the Le Monde journal , he was a man who gained 1.6 billion Euro from his transactions by the end of last year .
A Crisis Not Only in the U.S.
" All I ever wanted was to gain some money for my bank , " he claims in his testimony .
In the summer he managed to gain a half billion Euro from this American crisis .
He had found the opportunity at the beginning of the year .
The news appeared in February that the so-called sub-prime mortgage loans , provided to low-income clients or to those who had problems with paying them off in the past , are going to have problems .
Nevertheless , the crisis should not have influenced the entire economy .
Kerviel did not believe this and it was the right bet .
By the end of the year , his profit had climbed to 1.6 billion Euro .
" Even when I gained the first half billion , I didn 't know how to announce it , " admits Kerviel and adds that he definitely didn 't keep any of it for himself .
Throughout the entire hearing he has admitted that he forged the records so that he would not be revealed .
He managed to deceive his superiors , even though the Eurex Exchange became interested in his affairs .
Nothing ventured , nothing gained .
Was he afraid that he would be discovered ?
Rather not .
" I thought that the simple fact of my gaining 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them .
Where did he get the will to risk that much ?
He had to work up to his position gradually .
He entered Société Générale in the 2000 , immediately after he had finished his university studies in Lyon .
His annual income was around $ 51,000 .
Two years later , he was already an assistant to the broker , and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual income of $ 90,000 .
Still he knew he would never earn as much as the others .
" As early as during my first interview in 2005 , I knew they despised me .
Because of my education , and also for my professional and personal development , " Kerviel described the situation to the investigators .
But soon after Kerviel entered his career , the first big success followed .
Thanks to the Allianz shares he gained ; during the London bombings he bet a half billion Euro that they would fall .
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more .
As Long as You Gain , We Let You
" It 's like a snowball , " he told the police .
But his superiors are said to have known , or rather suspected the whole thing .
" As long as I was earning money for them , they pretended not to see . "
But then , at the beginning of the year , a blow came .
In a single day , he lost 1 billion Euro .
He wanted to expunge the whole thing after the weekend in the middle of January .
When he came to the office on Monday , he was no longer employed by the bank .
And a few days later , the bank announced it had lost 5 billion Euro because of him .
So how did they uncover him ?
He became suspicious through his vacations .
" I took only four days out of the last year .
A broker who does not take vacations is a broker who does not want anybody to look into his records , " Kerviel concluded .
NHS ' must check foreign workers '
Scottish NHS boards need to improve criminal records checks for employees outside Europe , a watchdog has said .
The recommendation from Auditor General Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked with the Glasgow Airport attack in June .
Mr Black also raised concerns that NHS Scotland had no accurate picture of the number of overseas staff it had .
But his report pointed out other key checks were properly carried out across a sample of five health authorities .
The auditor general looked into staff recruited outside European Economic Area countries , in the wake of the Glasgow Airport attack .
Bilal Abdullah , 28 , an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley , was arrested at the airport after a Jeep was driven into the doors of the main terminal building .
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Old Bailey by video link in October , charged in connection with the suspected car bomb attempts in the UK .
NHS boards are expected to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to ensure they have the qualifications , experience and authorisation to work in the UK .
Although Scots health boards use Disclosure Scotland to carry out criminal records checks , the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain such information outside Britain .
The auditor general 's report has now said , among other recommendations , that the boards should take on Criminal Records Bureau guidance , which helps employers with checks in several overseas countries .
" Although we found the some of the personnel records had evidence of these checks , this is not done routinely , " stated the report .
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS had a high level of compliance with its own pre-employment screening policies , but added : " Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of overseas NHS staff . "
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was " extremely unlikely " that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees people who might commit future terrorist acts .
" The report suggests that current pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver , " he said .
Scottish health authorities said they currently had 1,161 overseas staff , the vast majority of them doctors and nurses .
But the auditor general warned the numbers were likely to be higher , partly because boards had problems identifying which staff were on indefinite leave to remain .
The investigation also found that established check procedures at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran , Grampian , Greater Glasgow and Clyde , Lanarkshire , and Lothian were largely being met .
These included passport , work permit and qualification checks .
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for overseas staff in the NHS .
Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : " I was keen to have this work carried out in the wake of the terror attack on Glasgow Airport .
She added the Scottish Government , in conjunction with health boards , would consider the recommendations of the report and would ensure best practice was reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment checks for all staff - including those from overseas - it planned to publish next month .
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market ? The experts are divided by the ' subprime ' crisis .
With less than five weeks to the closing of the exercise , investors are already rubbing their hands hoping in the traditional year-end rally .
Nevertheless , this year the experts do not clearly know if this will happen .
Banif thinks that " from a statistical point of view , December usually has a positive effect on the stock market .
Nevertheless , it 's not opportune to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics , even more so in the present context , where uncertainties are visible in the markets , at least in the short term . "
Although they aren 't in favour of a stock-market run in the last weeks of the year , the experts point to " the stock market , which is maintained by liquidity , arranged to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees , especially the fixed rent , affected by the fled-effect towards quality shares as much in the long term as in the short one . "
For that , they think that stock-market will have a rather lateral behaviour , non-free of volatility " so we don 't know the impact of the Fed 's probability reduction types , for the high level of crude oil and the stimulating danger of the inflationary tensions . "
Javier Barrio , sales manager of BPI in Spain , agrees that it is not a good time to take risks , thinking that there will be a rally .
" It is not a pleasing thing , " assures the expert .
Ibex has lost nearly 4 % from the maximum reached on November 8th , when the index closed at 15945.7 points .
Even so , not all the experts share this negative viewpoint .
Juan Solana , Intermoney analyst , believes that Ibex 35 could close the year nearer to 16000 points thanks to portfolio reconstruction and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year on these dates .
However , the expert clarifies that things will be different this year , since he thinks that rally will occur during the second week of December , after the Constitution holiday .
The analyst does not consider that volatility is going to affect the market trend .
On the other hand , Federico Olucha , Inversis Bank analyst , thinks that we are near to technical levels and " therefore , as far as the consequences of the crisis on the credit market , we could see a rebound in the index that could be impelled depending on the news arriving from the U.S.A .. "
The analyst trusts that this will be positive .
The analysts agree to choose the shares that will be the ones in charge for taking Ithebex towards new maximum levels .
Solana , of Intermoney , affirms that " this year it 's the turn for the great stocks . "
The expert would include in the portfolio both : great banks and some constructors " because when the date arrives , the electrical sector will be very expensive . "
While , Federico Olucha , of Inversis Bank assures that the ascents will come from the banking and industrial sector .
The constructors also will be able to benefit from this rally , in case it happens .
" ACS takes several months recuperating , and we hope that other construction companies like Ferrovial and FCC go the same way , " explains the expert .
The consumer 's cycle will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in the sales figures during the Christmas sales season .
On the other hand , the expert thinks that the technological sales also will do very well although in this case there is not much presence in the Spanish market .
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years , only on two occasions December has been a bearish month .
The authentic year-end rally took place in the 2003 exercise where stock markets left the crisis caused by the technological bubble .
This year , where Ibex 35 recovered 28,17 % , December registered a growth of 6,68 % .
We 're going to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains ( at the moment Ibex has risen 8,36 % from January ) and whether there will be a year-end rally .
For the first time Telecinco doubles its stock market value when compared to its rival Antenna 3
" We 've done it . "
With that phrase Paolo Vasile , executive advisor of Telecinco , expressed yesterday his satisfaction at market closure , when it stated that it had reached a value of double that of its rival , Antenna 3 .
Only one aspect dimmed its joy : " It hurts me , not because we have grown more but because we have lowered less , " he affirmed .
Even so , he insisted that in a weak market , " we have fallen less . "
Telecinco closed the day with an advance of 2,54 % yesterday .
That gain puts the loss we suffered for the year at 15,66 % .
The value of the company 's shares , controlled by Mediaset ( with 52 % of the capital ) and participated by Vocento ( another 13 % ) , at the stock market reached therefore the 4,488.88 million Euros , according to data from Bloomberg .
It 's rival , Antenna 3 , that yielded 1.52 % and which yesterday accumulated a slope of 40.5 % from January , is valued at half that , 2,193.46 million .
Shares of other quoted communication companies rise ; to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable , 2518.53 million for Prisa ( publisher of Five Days ) and 1.779 million for Vocento .
According to Vasile , " we are speaking of two similar companies " and hence the comparison with Antenna 3 .
" The fact is how much are we able to operate within the same market , at what cost , and how we can profit in terms of customers . "
Telecinco announced last week that it anticipates this year to become the first TV chain in surpassing the 1,000 million gross advertising income , according to Giuseppe Tringali , delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña , the branch that manages the publicity of the group .
If the published data is true , the television network has registered this year an increase of 3,6 % in publicity revenue with respect to the 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise .
On the other hand , the net revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6 % in the first nine months of the exercise ( reaching 734.4 million ) whereas the net income of the television grew by 0.7 % ( 630,4 million ) .
One of the factors that the analysts point to as indicative of the evolution in Telecinco in the stock market is elevated payout that has been maintained until now : in 2006 , the company presided by Alexander Echevarría distributed the 100 % of the benefit among its shareholders .
Vasile assures that , although it is too soon to make a decision , this ratio may change after purchasing 33 % of Endemol in partnership with its parent company Mediaset .
" Officially , we are committed to pay out a minimum 50 % , although we have always declared more .
This year , I hope that we are able to leave our shareholders , to whom we have already given good value with 33 % of Endemol , " satisfied .
According to the analysts , the market shows signs of fatigue at the moment .
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco for 2008 to 4 % , and 2009 to 7 % .
It happens , they explain , because of the cut in the anticipated growth of income from 10.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009 .
This same company has lowered the forecasted profit of Antenna 3 to 4.5 % in 2008 and to 7.5 % in 2009 .
Three views
1 .
Ibersecurities : recommends buying both shares based primarily on its high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential .
2 .
Caja Madrid : Viewed Telecinco as better ( to accumulate ) than Antenna 3 ( to keep ) for the ' multiples attractive ' and business increase .
3 .
JPMorgan : recommends to weigh carefully both cases for " similar threats " ( saturated market and worse economic climate ) .
Popular will open its 200 offices for 12 hours daily from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew a large part of their offices .
In total 200 , located in the most commercial zones of Spain .
These branches will operate under the mark Popular Max and represent a big change for the bank .
This is also true for the rest of the Spanish banks , since this is the first group to decide to bet on an all-day aperture for their offices , until 20.30 in the evening , and open on Saturdays from 1000 to 2030 hours .
Another group that has also reiterated in several occasions that it wanted to extend the opening times of its branches , BBVA , has not yet decided to make the move .
While , it 's near to closing an agreement with the unions who insist on the closure of 75 % of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening late , although not to the public .
Results from Popular 's experience will be decisive for other banks to follow the initiative , depending on commercial hours .
Indeed this is the objective that Popular is chasing with this project .
To catch the particular clients that circulate in these zones to make their purchases , to SMEs , the independent and commercial sales of the chosen streets to open .
The bank needs to have these 200 offices open in all Spain within 18 months , since they are not building new offices but remodelling existing ones .
For that , the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial zones , adapting them to the clients profile of the different streets .
In this way , the extension of the opening times is accompanied by a different space concept of the branch and a new design with more luminous colours .
The manager of the commercial bank Angel Creek assures that this reconstruction does not require a great investment , although an increase in personnel is required since one needs to go from about six employees at the premises to eight or nine .
The offices , that will even have meeting rooms for SMEs , will not sell financial products .
One positive experience for the group .
Popular has tested its initiative on three offices in Madrid .
And it has been a positive experience , according to Ángel Rivero 's explanation .
Branches of Bravo Murillo , O 'Donnell and Gran Via streets of Madrid have been chosen , and it seems with success according to Rivero .
Today Popular accounts for 2500 branches .
And another 60 operate through the Mundocredit trademark , specifically for immigrants , which have increased opening times , and even open on Sundays and holidays .
In these PopularMax offices they don 't replicate the BBVA model , where several of their offices count on a great variety of non financial products for their commerce .
" We don 't want to compete with our clients , " says Rivero .
At present , they have agreed with Telefonica to sell cell phones , with personnel outside the bank .
The status quo choice
There won 't be any suspense at Sunday exit poll : Russians are opting overwhelmingly for the party of the President Putin , united Russia .
Confirming in this way their aim to stability , event to the authoritarianism , after an incisive campaign .
Three days before the legislative elections , the Russian president Vladimir Putin appeals to his voters with TV message on the public networks , which has already been registered but whose content rest kept in secret .
He acts as leading candidate of United Russia , the pro-Kremlin party for which is expected an overwhelming triumph .
Yesterday , welcoming the foreign ambassadors , the President did not betray anything , bringing just a further charge against the West , accused of interference - his favourite subject during the campaign .
" We know the price of a true democracy and we are expecting fair , absolutely clear and open elections , without any obstacles . , " he added .
According to the opposition , this result seems too far .
It denounces an under pressure campaign .
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that " there has never been so dirty elections , even in Eltsin times . "
After the repression of the last week-end demonstrations , it 's still forbidden to visit the ex world champion of flop , Garry Kasparov , sentenced to five days " imprisonment for illegal demonstration , said his lawyer .
" Russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality . "
Behind those legislative elections without any suspense , there are two wider questions :
- Who will be Putin 's successor ?
The official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the elections , on the 2nd March 2008 ; the candidates have time until the 23rd December to come forward .
Elected for the first time in 2000 and for a second time in 2004 , Vladimir Putin can not afford a third mandate .
At the present , there isn 't any emerging successor .
- Which role is Putin going to play after March ?
Prime Minister ?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the most powerful party United Russia , which is going to choose both the government and the president ?
Whatever the case may be , at the legislative elections , as well as at the presidential ones , the outgoing party will triumph .
It is a tradition .
" Russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality , they do not feel the owners of their destiny , " considers the sociologist Lev Goudkov , director of the Levada independent centre .
Nikolaï Kopossov , a historian of the St. Petersburg State University , goes farther : the civil society in this Christianized country was five centuries late than in Europe ; the well-known community attitude postponed the birth of individualism .
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s , " Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state , perfectly accepted by the population , considering that the new paternalism wasn 't followed by a period of terror but by economic affluence , " states Maria Lipman , of the Carnegie Foundation .
Russians are " voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility " that they had briefly shown after the collapse of the URSS .
" What 's to be considered then ? "
The phenomenon affects every social class , business included .
And the administrative elite aims to keep the status quo : 65 governors ( out of 85 leaders of Russian regions ) are heading the local lists of United Russia .
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonym of chaos , as it happened in the 1990s .
The public opinion prefers the stability .
It is the reason for which Russians won 't vote for extremists .
Here are Tamara Tcherednitchenko conclusions , 54-year-old professor : " What 's to be considered then ?
Those who are in power are not so bad , why changing them ? "
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another hole to fall into ; his way out of it remains the same
As British political scandals go , this one is not particularly juicy .
No honours seem to have been sold , no politician 's Parisian hotel bills picked up , no extramarital toes sucked .
But the revelation that a rich businessman disguised contributions to Britain 's governing Labour Party of more than £ 650,000 ( $ 1.3m ) over four years under other people 's names , and that the party failed to report it , is one the embattled Gordon Brown could well have done without .
Two months ago , when the prime minister ducked out of calling an election , stupidly insulting Britons ' intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision , the hope was that he would provide sturdy , efficient government .
Instead , as Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrats ' increasingly witty stand-in leader , put it , the once feared Mr Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr Bean .
The cack-handed rescue of Northern Rock , a troubled bank , showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire .
Ill-thought-out proposals to change the tax code have drawn business groups together against the government .
The tax authority 's loss of 25m people 's personal details revealed unimaginable administrative bungling .
A trio of retired generals launched a mutiny in the Lords , protesting against cuts in military spending : being armed-forces minister is , they claimed , a part-time job .
Now there are the multifaceted donations from David Abrahams ; Peter Watt , Labour 's general secretary ( and its previous head of compliance ) , has already resigned .
None of this means that Mr Brown is headed irrevocably for the exit .
Yet governments can reach a tipping point after which they find it impossible to govern .
People neither like nor trust politicians , but usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over .
Once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve things , and may not even be around for long , that suspension is over : the civil service starts leaking ; cabinet ministers start briefing ; the press looks for bad-news stories ; and government becomes defensive and unfocused .
In one way , Mr Brown 's position is particularly difficult , because unlike other political leaders he cannot claim to be a new broom .
Much though he would like to disown Tony Blair , he was his senior lieutenant .
The problems to do with Northern Rock and the tax-authority records , for instance , are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as chancellor of the exchequer .
And even when he was not directly involved in Blairish mishaps - such as the long " cash for peerages " inquiry into political-party funding - voters may well assume he was .
Yet Mr Brown 's predicament is not quite as bad as it looks .
The gaffes are not as appalling as the Tories are making out .
As with Mr Bean , no one has died , or been swindled outright .
And the remedy , painful though it may be , is to provide what Mr Brown 's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised : reliable , sound and slightly brutal government .
The new fuss about political donations is a good example .
The Garboesque Mr Abrahams , who compares his donations to his charitable giving , says he wished no public recognition for his benevolence .
That may be so , but the decision was not his to make .
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason : the public is entitled to know who may be buying access to those who rule the land .
Mr Watt , who says he knew of Mr Abrahams 's arrangement but not that it was illegal , will obviously face some close questioning ; so will Jon Mendlesohn , Labour 's chief fund-raiser who was told about the dodgy donations in October .
But so far Mr Brown is not involved : there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these convolutions , even though the bulk of the payments were made after he took office in June .
So far the prime minister has done half the job .
He was quick to condemn his party 's breach of the law , but he diluted that decisiveness by reaching for a familiar tool , a committee of inquiry into the matter - led , for good measure , by a retired bishop and a judge .
In this case , the " lessons to be learned " are not complicated .
If the law has been broken , it is a matter for the police .
Besides , there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do , such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life , which has been without one for six months , and pressing ahead with genuine reform of political-party funding .
That would require hard-up Labour to co-operate with the Tories and perhaps give up its special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partisan like Mr Brown .
But he should face some partisan facts .
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls ; he has two years to win back voters ; and the only way he can grind out a victory is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence .
Which insurance is good for me ?
The car insurance that covers the driver against possible claims , represents a major expense that would depend on various factors , such as age , sex , length of membership , marital status , the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter , among others .
Having the car is only the beginning .
Because choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model .
First we must be clear what we are talking about .
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured .
This commitment is translated into an insurance contract , which stipulates that the company will receive the agreed premium and in return it is responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of loss .
The premium is the insurance price , which is established considering diverse factors , such as the age , sex , the length of membership , marital status , the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter , among others .
The insuring companies establish their prices based on the statistics , so that the greater the probability of having an accident is , the greater the premium is .
It is for this reason that both drivers older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums , since statistics show that they have a smaller accident index due to their prudence .
Also , making use of the statistics , companies have reached the conclusion that the married people tend to have less accidents than celibate drivers .
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency , and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap .
Increasing the frequency increases the probabilities .
There are many variables that the insurers consider when establishing the price of the premium .
It is for this reason , that the driver has to study his situation to choose the insurance that better adjusts his profile .
Presented here are the most significant variables in choosing one or another kind of insurance that , in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured , offers a reasonable price .
People younger than 25 years have diverse disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance at a reasonable price , as the reduced driving experience and the length of the membership .
Although , to be well insured , it is ideal to have a fully comprehensive insurance , other economic options exist .
The most cautious drivers can decide for a franchise with any risk , so that they obtain the insurance coverage , but at a price more feasible .
This class of agreement would suppose that the client cover a part of the costs in case of mishaps .
" The amount of the costs that contributes the client will be settled based on the value of the premium , that will be higher if this amount is lowered , " specifies Luis Noguera , head of First Europe in Spain , mediator of online insurances .
Another option is an extended third party insurance , so that the client is assured protection from damages caused to third parties , although not to those caused to his own car .
In addition , it would be covered for robbery , fire and the loss of the vehicle .
An advice .
If you are younger than 25 years try to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible , since this will be an advantage , being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future .
An advantage is a reduction on the basic tariff of the company .
On the contrary , a penalty is a surcharge on this base tariff .
" Advantages and penalties will depend on the company and its benefits .
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the advantages , " clarifies Noguera .
Once over 25 years of age drivers have an easier time of contracting an insurance , since the accident index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience .
For this reason the most recommendable is to contract a fully comprehensive with tax exemption .
" Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident , or even when driving , " assures the director in Spain of the European company , to which adds that most of the accidents take place in the second year of driving , once the " fear of the novice " passes .
Nevertheless , if the client is married but still doesn 't have children it is better to negotiate an comprehensive insurance , as long as his economic situation allows it , clearly .
On the other hand , people married with children are considered by the insurers as the public with accident rate , reason why the premiums will be smaller .
In this case the best one is a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption ( this being of 300 euros ) , or , when it is had , a high benefit level , a third-party extended as the third life 's year of the vehicle .
" They make a more relaxed driver and have a greater spending power to allow the luxury to assume an amount of greater tax exemption , " states Luis Noguera .
For the pensioners a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption ( being this one of 150 euros ) , or a third party when a high level of advantage is had .
It is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important , not only because it covers the driver over possible wrecks , but because it represents an important cost , reason for which it is fundamental to suitably study the insurance that agrees to us most according to our personal situation .
the moment you decide to meet expectations , you cease to be interesting
I 'm creeping along in the car in the usual morning traffic jam .
The radio starts playing an unusual tune : it 's a violin sound with special electronic effects .
I give it a bit more volume .
The music changes beat and a base tone joins the other instruments . Then , like a true jewel , a female choir steps in .
I 'm listening to Zagar 's Wings of Love on mr2 .
The domestic music world hasn 't spoiled us with high quality electronic pop in a long time .
But now , all of a sudden you can look at the traffic jam in a new light while listening to the new Zagar CD .
The appearance of Yonderboi and the few new and exciting productions that have popped up from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture . Although guitar-pinging garage rock is back in style , domestic electropop is ready to prove that there IS something new under the sun .
Balázs Zságer got his start in Pécs and even played in the Yonderboi ensemble for a time . Then , maybe because this town just wasn 't big enough for the two of them - he moved on to do his own thing .
His project ( Zagar ) and his music , an alloy of jazz , electronic dance music , and pop began pushing upward into the public ear when he was suddenly asked to compose soundtracks for films ( such as
Ferenc Török 's Ferenc Szezon [ Season ] ) .
A wider audience got to know his combos , which initially played in smaller clubs , when " wan2 " magazine listed his first CD among Hungary 's top 50 in 2002 and said Zagar was the only member of Yonderboi who was marketable in the west and who looked like a domestic trend-setter .
No question about it , Zagar and his group became " trendy . " But , no one bothered to ask them if they liked the label .
The group responded with a new and even better CD .
Their latest , called Cannot Walk Fly Instead , which is just out , can open new vistas although in itself the title seeks to connect them to their early years in Pécs .
The title is a line used by Balázs Zságer 's old Pécs group .
We would be on course with the easygoing reference to flight but for the effects of the louder guitar and the rock and roll beat that joins the soaring tones , homage to the spirit of the times .
György Ligeti , who sings in Britain with The Puzzle , made his intro with these tunes , when the disc was premiered at the Millenáris .
The CD produced a real radio hit. mr2 Petőfi , which of late has been playing pop music from morning till night , started a stealth offensive on our ears with Wings of Love and the soaring sounds produced by the six Hungarian female singers ( " Underground Divas " ) .
So , everything 's okay . Or is it ?
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer .
hvg.hu : The question this new hit song raises is just how culty your music has remained ?
Zságer : I don 't see much meaning in the term cult music .
I think there are two light music castes ; not mainstream and underground and not alternative and pop , but commerce and honest .
So-called alternative or underground music can be dull and uninspiring and produced for the sole purpose of boosting sales , which puts it in the commerce category .
While a good pop song can be sparked by honest motives .
The attitudes of the recipients operate in that spirit , irrespectively of language and national boundaries .
hvg.hu : Do you see any difference in the receptivity of domestic and international audiences as far as your music goes ?
B.Zs. : Light music has more tradition abroad , especially west of here .
Over there , older people also come to concerts , not just teens and twenty-somethings .
They pay far more attention to changes in the genre because they consider it a part of contemporary culture .
hvg.hu : What role does the audience play in your work ?
Do the people who listen to your music , and the number who listen make a difference ?
B.Zs. : Of course it feels good to see more and more people at our concerts .
But we have never designed our music for the market .
Our music comes from inspiration , not some target or goal .
The role of the audience comes out at the concerts when the effects are contagious , but even that comes from the intangible changes triggered by the moment .
I have actually noticed that the moment you decide that you want to meet audience expectations , you cease to be interesting .
hvg.hu : To what extent do you plan to follow Yonderboi 's example ?
He 's a soloist and has built a career west of where we are .
B.Zs. : We 're not really following his path even though sometimes people claim to hear him in our music .
We are much stronger team players . We trust one another 's musical presence and allow that to thrive .
In the beginning there was no way to avoid having our music compared to Yonderboi since several of us split from that group , though we chose a different road .
hvg.hu : Wings of Love hit first place on mr2 Petőfi 's hit parade .
Many folks first heard the name Zagar with this number .
Was the more popular style a deliberate outreach to a broader audience ?
B.Zs. : We never planned to have a hit to boost CD sales .
That song is about much more .
We intended it to wrap up the album , to try to lighten up the orgy of tone and the tougher themes earlier in the CD .
hvg.hu : How did you choose the six female singers ?
Why did you pick the voices you did - what was your guiding principle ?
B.Zs. : The idea was to have a sound like a gospel choir .
It occurred to us to put the choir together using soloists from the domestic music scene who sing really well .
That gave us the six-voice choir - of Sena , Edina Kutzora , Judie Jay , Bori Péterfy , Enikő Hodosi [ Neo ] , and Juci Németh - , whom we simply named Underground Divas .
hvg.hu : Is the result exactly as you envisioned it , or did the girls play a role in shaping the sound ?
B.Zs. : We had had an instrumental version of it for quite some time . But then , when we were putting the CD together , we got the feeling that we needed to add something .
The chordal sequence was crying out for a vocal section .
I sang the melody onto the instrumental that day , and that was how the girls learned it afterwards .
The whole thing came to me all at once and it was shockingly spontaneous .
I remember being totally excited by it at the time , but the Divas really were necessary to make it work .
It never would have been this powerful in my voice .
hvg.hu : The girls appeared to be secondary , on both the disc and at the concert .
There is no solo ( excepting Judy Jay 's tiny one ) , they have no separate role , they sing completely in unison and they don 't outsing the music , so it 's not as though they were singing to subordinate musical accompaniment .
On stage , they stood at the back .
Was all that deliberate ?
B.Zs. : The reason why they stood at the back of the stage was because of technical problems .
But not distributing solos was deliberate .
The whole number was about forgetting our egos for a time , not caring who came from where and where they are headed , and simply letting those wings , the wings of love , lift us up .
I wanted others to also get the feeling of the euphoria we went through when the song was born .
hvg.hu : Which one gave you the most work ?
B.Zs. : None really , as far as the process of musical creation was concerned - but some of them gave us a hard time with the arrangement .
For instance Dorian Gray 's Dilemma , where I play on a concert piano , or Rock 'n'Roll Goes To The Girls , where the groove didn 't want to work for the longest time - but everything eventually ended up fitting , kind of like a jigsaw puzzle .
hvg.hu : What 's your own favourite number on this CD ?
B.Zs. : That keeps changing with every concert , especially now that I 've already let go of the CD .
At the moment it 's Prophet is A Fool , Escape from the Earth , and Never the Same .
Six little things you can annoy your colleagues with
The e-mails we forget to send , the voice-mail messages we never get , the white lies we tell and no longer even notice - they can all colour day-to-day life on the job .
The question is whether you get used to the minor annoyances or pick up the gauntlet and deliberately avoid dubious situations that can irritate others .
A few tips .
" Oops , sorry . I forgot to tell you that marketing was looking for you , " says one of your colleagues .
Oh , you missed a meeting because of that ?
In a best case scenario , he or she will apologize and try to mend things . He or she might even phone marketing to explain about the forgotten message ( this scenario is quite rare ) .
In most cases the matter ends with an apology .
Before getting into a situation where you have to apologize , it is worth thinking about the things you might do to give your colleagues a few unpleasant minutes , and then deliberately try to avoid doing them .
Do you borrow things that don 't belong to you ?
Nothing is more annoying than reaching for a document , piece of office equipment or telephone which turns out not to be there .
You remember having left your stapler on your desk but it appears to have grown wings overnight .
Perhaps you see the pen you thought you lost lying on your colleague 's desk .
Don 't take anything away from a colleague 's desk without asking . They have every right to be angry if you make off with their belongings .
Do not pocket office envelopes or Post-It notes . It can be very irritating if they run out prematurely , especially if you 're the one who needs one immediately .
Do you gossip about your colleagues ' private lives ?
There is no good way to halt gossip that has already begun to spread .
Who is doing what with whom ?
Where and why ?
There 's no need to spread your information ( assumptions ) about your colleague all through the house !
If someone shares his or her most intimate secrets with you , do not abuse that trust !
Keep what you hear to yourself . When a colleague is out , do not discuss his or her private life with others , even if they also know what the person has been up to .
Do you call in sick , when you 're not ?
When you call in sick because of a splitting headache , or when you just don 't feel good , or when you think it would be better to spend the day resting , think about the colleagues who will have to take up the slack and get all your urgent things done by deadline .
Do not play dirty with your colleagues !
If you know beforehand that you are not going to be in , or if something happens that forces you to stay home for a day , let your colleagues and supervisor know in advance . Don 't surprise them by not showing up .
Humming , hooting , phoning
Have you ever been totally immersed in your work , only to lose your concentration because of guffawing colleagues ?
Have you ever been an unwilling earwitness to a phone conversation it would have been better not to have heard ?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming , singing , or loud talking ( right over their heads ) , tapping rhythms with your feet , continuous cursing or loudly voiced complaints .
All of these things can be irritating , even if people are not concentrating on a project ( writing , planning or organizing something ) at that very moment .
Do you blame others for your mistakes ?
If something isn 't ready by deadline , if you forgot to send out an important letter or pass on a message , do not blame others for your forgetfulness !
Do not blame chaotic conditions in the office - even if they exist - or your noisy colleagues !
Admit that you made the mistake and someone else suffered the consequences , and do what you can to make amends !
Ask how you can repair the damage and do what it takes to make things right !
Is the office too much like a second home ?
Track suit and slippers : quite comfortable when you 're at home , but they are not office wear !
Do not dress for leisure at the office , even if your job allows it !
Do not be sloppy . Show respect for your colleagues and yourself by dressing tastefully - and elegantly if your job requires it - to go to work .
National Debt to Vault to a Trillion in 2009
There is national debt of more than 84 000 crowns for each Czech .
The total debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns .
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year .
But at the beginning of December the ministry cut the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improved development of use of the state budget .
The Czech Republic 's national debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns .
It has risen by 40.2 billion crowns in the nine months of this year .
Though it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns since June .
This is the way in which the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October today .
A debt of more than 84,000 crowns for each Czech .
During all of last year , the state incurred debts of more than 111 billion crowns .
" For now it appears that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year , we should not break the trillion crown limit until 2009 .
Next year the debt should range from 900 billion to a trillion crowns , " Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHned.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it in a similar way : " We can get over the trillion limit in the course of the year 2009 .
The exact date will depend on the next budget , which we do not know yet .
If the situation in the political arena were to change , the politicians would be willing to spare more , it could be postponed to 2010 .
But we do not predict such a change , " he said .
Debts Are Growing
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government and emerges above all due to the accumulation of state budget deficits .
The national debt is financed by treasury notes , government bonds , direct loans or for example by loans from the European Investment Bank .
The state 's internal debt has risen 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year .
The foreign debt of the state has risen 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year .
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns by the end of September and has fallen 13.7 billion crowns since June .
The average due date of the national debt rose to 6.5 years .
" The absolute interim debt for the first to third quarter rose 13 percent , which is quite a lot compared to the state of the economy .
What is interesting is that the growth is generated especially through bonds , where the growth is 20 percent .
It is bad that the debt is growing , but on the other hand it shows that we will have something to trade when the pension reform comes , " Pikora commented on the data .
Better than Expected
It follows from the strategy of national debt financing and control for 2007 that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year .
But at the beginning of December , the ministry decreased the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to improved development of the use of the state budget .
The sum consists mainly of the state budget deficit , which will probably reach 76 billion crowns instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns this year .
It also includes the planned maximal resources of 13.3 billion crowns for the Czech Consolidation Agency , a ten billion reserve for pension pay-outs , financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the instalment payment of the loans from the European Investment bank totalling 1.8 billion crowns .
Many hospitals try to save by cutting disinfectant use
Hospitals have registered over a thousand cases of infections triggered mainly by the inappropriate use of antibiotics .
Hospital cleanliness , overcrowding , and overburdened staff are not conducive to halting infections , said the division chief at the National Centre for Epidemiology .
Many places even try cutting back on disinfectant use to save money .
An MRSA - an antibiotic resistant staphylococcus - infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology ward of János hospital .
The infection was detected in a man who had been hospitalized after a major accident .
The patient was isolated .
The same hospital had had to contend with a similar infection early this year .
It had discharged a patient admitted after a serious traffic accident . Shortly afterward , it had to re-admit the patient because of an MRSA infection , and doctors have been unable to perform surgery that would be vital to full recovery because they have been unable to get rid of the staph .
This year , up to 10th of December , hospitals have reported 1,094 cases of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System , said National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief Karolina Böröcz .
This tells us the number of cases of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that hospitals actually included in their records , but nothing more .
About two-thirds of the infections ( 683 cases ) were caused by MRSAs , whose official name is a methicillin ( oxacillin ) resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
One-third of all people carry the Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) bacteria in their noses without it ever causing an infection .
The infections SA does cause ( such as sore throat , tonsillitis , minor skin infections , and wound infections ) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated .
However , if antibiotics are overused or inappropriately used , the bacteria that originally responded well to antibiotics can evolve into an antibiotic-resistant variety , which spreads rapidly in hospitals if hygienic conditions are lax .
Particularly at risk are elderly and low-body-weight patients whose immune systems have been temporarily or permanently compromised . Among these patients , the staph can cause serious nosocomial infections such as wound infections or sepsis .
According to János Hospital 's medical director , there is nothing unusual about having an MRSA infection since they are part of everyday hospital life .
One should not confuse an infection with an epidemic , Tibor Nyulasi says . MRSA will be found everywhere anyone bothers to test for it , he adds .
Antibiotic resistance
" We isolate patients with MRSA and nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when working with infected patients . We also have the appropriate antibiotics needed to treat them , " says Nyulasi .
When a patient is admitted to the hospital , one of the first things done is to check for the presence of MRSA , but hospitals are still vulnerable to infection .
Testing for the staph isn 't fashionable
The vast majority of nosocomial MRSA-induced infections could be prevented said Böröcz . However , she added that current hospital conditions are not conducive to preventing the evolvement and spread of antibiotic-resistant infections .
Since this type of infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes , hospitals should routinely check all newly admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA carriers .
But , taking microbiological samples from patients is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals .
One reason is that the National Health Insurance Fund does not cover the costs of these tests .
In most cases the bacteria remain unnoticed unless the patient has an obvious MRSA infection , said the National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief .
The European Union has stringent protocols on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungary has its own guidelines on treating various infections and pathologies .
The goal should be targeted therapy , meaning that microbiology tests should be conducted to prevent resistance from evolving , but hospitals do not always keep to this .
It is even rarer to take a microbiology sample among outpatients in primary or specialized care , Böröcz added .
Saving money by cutting back on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that the most common way MRSA is transferred from one patient to another through healthcare personnel who carry it from patient to patient .
Therefore , washing hands , and wearing gloves and masks play a significant role in prevention , but here again , we find many shortcomings in hospital practices .
MRSAs are transmitted through physical contact and body fluids . Under domestic hospital conditions , an infected patient cannot always be isolated .
In fact , hospital wards are often overcrowded , with beds too close to one another although they should be at least 1.5 metres apart to conform to epidemiological requirements .
Sadly , we also find that when hospitals are short on funds they tend to save on disinfectants , said Böröcz , adding that with a shortage of nursing staff and too many patients , chances of infection increase .
According to Böröcz , there are demonstrably fewer infections , and those that occur are easier to prevent from spreading , in hospitals that take appropriate protective measures .
Government programme to combat MRSA
Treating MRSA infections costs the health insurer huge amounts of money , so efforts should be made everywhere to keep them from occurring in the first place .
In the UK for example , the government has a programme in place to cut back MRSA and prevent its spread .
The programme appears to be successful for published data shows that MRSA is on the decline in the UK .
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) has set prevention of the evolvement of multi-resistant pathogens ( including MRSA ) and of nosocomial infections as a priority project .
Today , she came before Khartoum court for having named a teddy bear
The English teacher tried in Sudan for offending Islam has been sentenced to 15 days ' imprisonment and to expulsion by Khartoum court on Thursday night , explained her lawyer .
The English teacher has been accused of allowing her pupils aged between 6 and 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear , when every representation of the Islam 's prophet is banned .
She was liable to lashes punishment .
This 54-year-old English teacher , who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan , has been arrested last Sunday at her home , with the accuse both of threatening Islam and sedition , according to the article no . 125 of the Sudanese criminal code , following many complaints of the children 's parents to the Sudan 's Ministry Of Education .
In fact , the case goes back to the month of September , when the school teacher asked her pupils , aged between 6 and 7 , to choose a name for the class teddy bear .
" Eight names came out from the children 's mouth , among those Hassan , Abdullah and Muhammad , " explains the school headmaster Robert Boulos .
At the end , after the class " vote , 20 children out of 23 have chosen Muhammad as their favourite name .
Surely , Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet , but first of all it 's a very common name in Sudan .
Then , the children created a book for the class with the bear 's picture followed by the legend " My name is Muhammad . "
The bear itself didn 't wear any label with that name , but the problem lies in the prophet 's representation , considered as an offence to Islam .
A Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons , who 's a teacher in the same school in Sudan , has highlighted that he knew her well and that she would have never done anything offensive for any faith , " I 'm just sorry she has asked her pupils to vote for a name , " according to him , it 's simply an " innocent mistake . "
It 's an opinion shared with many of the teacher 's pupils , who describe her as " very attentive towards her pupils " and " a person who never talks about religion within the class . "
Moreover , it should be reminded that Muhammad is the second most common name in Great Britain , which is written in English in 14 different ways .
This name , which is often chosen by Muslim families , is one way of honouring the prophet ( it is often given to the family 's firstborn ) .
But which rules regulate the use of that name ?
For instance , is it possible to give it to a toy ?
Certainly , it 's a matter of interpretation .
600 Thousand People Did Not Manage to Renew Driver 's Licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not manage to renew their old driver 's licenses , the validity of which will expire at the end of the year .
Today is the last day for people to apply for the renewal so that the authorities could manage to issue the new license by the end of the year .
However , the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would set out on the road without a valid license after New Year 's Eve .
According to the authorities , it is mostly those who do not want to drive anymore who did not renew the license .
While villages report a sharp decline in interest in driver 's license renewal , the authorities in the city are overloaded with applications and the interest in the license renewal has grown this week .
The municipal council handles about 2000 clients a day .
They spend about half an hour waiting in line .
Roughly 140,000 drivers have not renewed their driver 's license yet in Prague .
The issue of a new license takes twenty days .
However , it is possible to apply for the issue in the reduced time limit of five days .
In that case , the driver pays five hundred crowns extra .
Motorists who do not manage the renewal of the license before the end of the year and set on the road without a valid driver 's license will be threatened with a fine .
A person who breaks the law will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns .
But the police can also settle the offence through a settlement .
In case of an administrative offence , the fine will climb to 2,500 crowns .
According to earlier information the council could even fine someone who does not drive at all .
Reportedly , such an individual could have paid up to 30,000 crowns .
The ministry earlier asked the authorities to be reasonable and issue a thousand-crown fine at the most .
However , according to Ministry of Transport speaker Karel Hanzelka , nobody will be threatened with ten-thousand-crown fines .
According to him , a driver 's license is a document which the people should be allowed to decide whether they want or not .
It is not an identity card which everybody must keep validated .
Those who do not want to drive anymore should give the license up .
It is sufficient to take it to the competent municipal office or send it by registered post .
By the end of the year , the validity of the licenses issued during 1964-1993 will have expired .
However , motorists must also subsequently renew other types of driver 's licenses .
People with driver 's licenses from 1994-2000 have three more years for the renewal .
The validity of the licenses issued 2001-2004 will end in December 2013 .
According to Hanzelka , this concerns roughly 2.6 million other documents .
An Account of the Baby Switch : 12 million
The lawyer for the aggrieved families , Igor Veleba , is requesting 12 million Czech crowns in compensation for the switch of the babies in a maternity clinic in the Třebíč hospital , plus legal expenses .
Three million for each of the mothers , two for each father and a million for each child .
The hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents .
The hospital 's attorney , Ondřej Dostál , therefore radically disapproves of Veleba 's proposition .
" We reject such a claim , it is too high , " Dostál said after today 's meeting .
" To be able to define our position to the counter-motion , we need the expert opinion the opposing side has had made .
We will find out if it has any informative value at all .
Still , we stick to our opinion that it is going to be in hundreds of thousands for all , " Dostál stressed .
According to him , the sum should range from 100,000 to 200,000 for each of the four parents .
At the beginning of the case , the Jabloňov family demanded a million crowns for each month they were not with their biological daughter .
Veleba used the expert opinion which the Motol University Hospital in Prague had elaborated for him as a basis for the negotiations .
According to the advisors in the field of psychology and psychiatry , the parents of the children have suffered psychological injury and stress of various degrees and intensity .
The stressful situation was better endured by the men , though they struggled with remorse that they did not prevent the switch of the newborn babies .
On the other hand , the women are coping worse with the urgency of the trauma experienced and of what is happening right now , Veleba summed up .
Veronika and Nikola were switched by the nurses in the Třebíč maternity clinic on December 9 of the last year .
Last week , the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks to Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov .
Vysočina county supervisor Miloš Vystrčil gave 100,000 CZK to each of the families as compensation for the expenditures that ensued from the mistake by the Třebíč hospital , run by the county .
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured for the liability for damages by law .
In case of error , they have to dig into the reserve fund , and in exceptional cases they can seek help from the founder .
By now the courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people , with the sums calculated according to the tables in six digit numbers , exceptionally in seven digit numbers , in Czech crowns .
So They 've Approved Our Budget
That 's it .
The state budget has been accepted .
What makes this budget special ?
It is the first budget built by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition .
The one for this year was passed last year still with the support of the Czech Social Democratic Party ( CSSD ) , because it was prepared by minister Sobotka and CSSD could not afford for it to not be accepted .
In contrast to the animated debate before the vote of no-confidence in the government , nothing extreme has occurred this time .
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this traditionally overlooked but most influential law easily .
It is a sort of paradox .
Each governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget , like it or not .
The budget is a substantial part of politics , but it is covered by the struggle for power between the government and the opposition .
It is more widely appreciated by the media , that is why the media pay much more attention to it .
The politicians ' quarrels are much more interesting for the public than straight numbers .
The state budgets of the past social democratic governments suffered from three maladies which 2008 's budget is not able to resolve all at once :
First , there is the high portion of the expenditures mandatory by law , the so-called mandatory expenditures , including not only pensions , but also social benefits passed last year before the elections by the silent " alliance " of CSSD and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia ( KSCM ) .
Second , there is the deficit economy as a result of the first malady .
The third limit is the deficits in public financing , i.e. the budget deficit of cities and villages .
However , the state budget deficit is not the biggest risk .
It is public and relatively under control .
The time bomb here is the deficit of the budgets of cities and villages .
Many mayors , in order to gain resources for their investments other than the money from taxes , fees , and bank loans , often mindlessly issued securities , with which they unreasonably incurred debt for the councils .
In the past years , they managed to pay the debts off by the mass sale of stocks of the power and distribution networks they acquired from the state during privatization .
They no longer have this resource .
If we stick just to the official and certifiable facts , we discover that :
Our economy has already been passing through the phase of growth for a few years , as is the rest of the world , about which CSSD keeps boasting .
This has been a unique opportunity for its governments to put public financing in order .
But instead they continued incurring debt for the state more and more .
Other countries , with a few exceptions such as Hungary , Albania , Pakistan or Egypt , have managed the money much more reasonably than our republic .
It is a huge shame , which falls mainly upon the previous governments .
We are among the countries which are , measured globally , endangered by poverty to the least extent .
Therefore there is no need for any massive social programs , which have unfortunately been inflated to a huge extent in the past years .
Though they managed to cancel a part of the absurd populistic expenditures passed this year before the elections , if the shift of the age limit for retirement and the revision of pensions does not take place soon , any politics in this country will virtually end , regardless of who is ruling then , it will be mere paperwork .
With a bit of exaggeration , we can say that the governing politicians will become white-collar workers mechanically distributing most of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits .
Therefore this year 's budget cannot be revolutionary in any way , it can only set back the mandatory expenditures pushing away the normal expenditures .
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally useless if the past governments had not lost as much as they could during the last ten years .
If we do not want to let the governing politicians become mere white-collar workers , we have to be patient and allow the not very strong coalition government , which is aware of the fact that the state can give over only as much as it can obtain on taxes and charges , peace for the preparation of other reform laws .
Only they will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget .

Banks Want to Solve Crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank , The European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain , Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight against the crisis on financial markets together .
More than $ 100 billion will enter the monetary markets by means of public sales .
In public sales , banks bid on the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money .
For example , the American Fed will send $ 40 billion into public sale and make 24 more available to the European and Swiss Central Banks .
It is the first time after the September 11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states settled on such a coordinated procedure aimed at preventing or decreasing the effects of a financial crisis .
" This step should solve the biggest economic problems , i.e. the growing lack of free capital banks can lend , " wrote Bernard Baumohl from the counselling company Economic Outlook Group in the report for his clients .
" The coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of the recession in the U.S. from 65 percent to about 50 percent , " added Baumohl in the report .
Banks have already lost $ 60 billion due to the non-repaid loans , especially in the U.S.
The analysts expect further billion-dollar losses .
" The central banks must be very afraid of what more can follow , if they decided in favour of such a procedure , " said the main economist of ABN Amro , Kieran Davies .
" It seems that the situation is really bad , " he added .
The central banks worry that if the banks themselves have a difficult access to loans , they will also lend to their customers for more .
That will lower the consumption and send the American economics into a recession , with possible impact on the economic growth of the whole world .
The central banks made this decision after the failure to lower the so-called LIBOR rate , a London interbank rate , which is used for lending money on a wholesale market .
This meant that the banks still feared mutual money lending , even though the central banks of the U.S. , Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn .
" It will have the same effect as another decrease in the interest rates , " Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting told Reuters .
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks ' step will help ward off the crisis , because it does not solve the basic problem , the real estate market drop in the U.S.
Auchan prices are highest , Tesco 's are up by almost 20 percent
The giant supermarkets located in the shopping triangle at Budaörs hiked prices by an average of 16 percent for the second year in a row , though they did not have to contend with a VAT increase which they did last year .
Article from Napi Gazdaság
Prices In Napi 's usual Christmas basket were up by an average of 16 percent again this year in the Budaörs shopping triangle , with each of the giant supermarkets pushing prices up by well over a thousand forints .
Since supermarket prices went through the roof last December , the hikes did not look quite as drastic percentage-wise , when compared to that high base .
Nonetheless , it has to be a shock to consumers to discover that they need over ten thousand forints to buy the same products they could get for well under nine thousand a year ago .
Napi 's basket exceeded the psychological HUF 10,000 limit by a minimum of HUF 91 at the giant supermarkets tested .
The most expensive basket cost us 10 573 forints .
( in 2003 , the same basket came to 6,800 forints . )
The price of Unicum and live fish stayed at roughly last year 's level , but boneless turkey breast , walnuts , and poppy seeds were up significantly .
We found the price of flour and bread to be mostly in line with official Statistics Office data , though we discovered bread going for 139 forints a kilogram at Auchan .
The competition factor was not enough to push the product 's price down to under 200 forints .
Another surprise in this store was that it charged less than 200 forints for a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola in a bottle with a deposit on it , so the full price including deposit was still only 257 forints .
Nevertheless , this year Napi 's basket cost the most at Auchan and the least at Cora .
We worked the numbers and found that Napi 's basket cost 15 percent more than last Christmas at Cora , while it was 18 percent more expensive at both Tesco and Auchan .
The difference between last year 's most expensive and this year 's cheapest basket cost was 12 percent , while the gap between last year 's cheapest and this year 's most expensive one was 21 percent .
In forints , the average increase was 1,480 .
Last year , the average increase came to 1,206 forints , which included the effects of a VAT hike .
And this was the factor that totally confused the commerce sector . The supermarkets were obviously unable to decide on the size of the price gap to apply to specific products , finding it impossible to calculate the effect the price increases would have on consumption .
( If the outlet makes a mistake in calculating the turnover velocity of a product , it stands to take a major hit on its profits with a price gap adjusted to turnover intensity . )
Last year , with the VAT hike the price increase in Napi 's basket ran up against such extremes that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints over the 2006 level , while the cheapest was only 844 forints more expensive .
This year , there were no such extremes , with the most expensive basket being 1,630 forints up from last year while the cheapest was 1,284 forints higher .
A comparison of the two Christmas seasons threw light on a disastrous jump in prices . In less than 20 months , day-to-day consumer goods soared by over 30 percent in the giant supermarkets .
( This is not quite in line with official Statistics Office data : its figures show price increases of over 30 percent in just 12 months for certain basic foodstuffs
including both flour and eggs . )
Napi 's basket suggested that this latter was a near impossibility , since we found that the price was up by just a shade over 10 percent on last year 's quite high base price , even where it was most expensive .
It does appear though , that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg producers , for they have managed to force their drastic price increases onto the multinationals .
Nonetheless , none of the supermarkets in the golden shopping triangle were complaining . All regularly reported that they were having a good year .
We found that most shoppers in the three outlets visited were not really interested in prices .
They tended to shop in bulk , buying durable foodstuffs by the pallet .
On a Wednesday morning there were long queues at all cash registers following a sudden increase in shoppers .
However , to our knowledge , turnover is lower in the rural areas . Several of the multinationals have been complaining to pollsters that their inflow has been below the anticipated level in both groceries and durable consumers .
Government crisis coming , says Gallup
Fidesz support shot up significantly in early December after a lengthy period of just holding its own . This gives it the strongest support base it has seen since 2002 , while Gallup reports support for the socialists at an all-time low of 13 percent .
Among people with a clear party preference , given the stronger resolve of opposition voters , Fidesz support exceeds the two-thirds mark ( 71 percent ) , while MSZP has garnered but one-fifth ( 20 percent ) .
The poll puts MDF and SZDSZ numbers below the threshold needed to get into parliament ; garnering about 2 percent support each within the entire sample .
Among people with clear party preferences who say they definitely would vote , support for these two parties is 3 percent each .
The public mood regarding the economy has managed to sink even lower than the rock-bottom last measured . The proportion who believe the country 's economy is in the pits is an unprecedented 41 percent , while another 46 percent just think it is in bad shape .
Following higher hopes in spring and summer , people are again more pessimistic about the financial prospects for their families .
For next year , over half the public expects things to get worse and only one in ten predicts an improvement .
In Gallup 's December poll , more respondents than ever before - 71 percent - said the prime minister was doing a poor rather than a good job .
Thirteen percent of the sample said it trusted or highly trusted Ferenc Gyurcsány , while 38 percent put their trust in Viktor Orbán .
Fifty-four percent said they did not trust the PM , while 27 percent said they mistrusted the Fidesz chairman .
One gauge of the political situation is the proportion of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed without having to put a new government in office .
Following last October 's rioting , 35 percent of the public thought it would be best to keep the government and PM in office . By now that proportion is down to 20 percent and the relative majority ( 33 percent ) believes new elections should be held .
When queried about interest in a referendum , 60 percent of the sample said it definitely would vote in one , while another 20 percent said it most likely would go to the polls .
In comparison , only 55 percent said it would definitely vote " in parliamentary elections if they were to be held this Sunday " while another 15 percent said it most likely would cast a ballot . Given current determination to vote , the referendum is certain to be valid .
74 percent of people want to repeal tuition fees , 79 percent to scrap co-payments for doctor visits and 84 percent want to end per diem hospital charges .
Looking only at the ratios of people who say they definitely will vote in the referendum , we find that 81 percent are against tuition fees , 84 percent are against doctor co-payments and 89 percent oppose hospital per diems .
Political Capital : The Hungarian Guard has heightened the country 's risk level
Actions by the Hungarian Guard , established in August with the support of the Movement for a Righter Hungary , has raised the political risk level of Hungary and the entire region from a number of aspects , according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital .
The research entity issued a " risk warning , " writing : the actions of the Hungarian Guard are triggering an exceeding political risk " that the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy residents of Hungary could heat up to toxic levels as early as the short-term , leading to ethnic conflicts that could turn violent . "
The major reason for this is that Hungarian Guard 's political strategy appears to be aimed at provoking action of this nature , the research institute added .
This is the outcome of one of the most serious failures of Hungary 's political players : " The primary actors in public life turned over public debate of Roma issues to representatives of the radical and extremist political forces , who have built a political strategy out of Gypsy-Hungarian differences . "
This , Political Capital believes , has intensified the problem , rendering any normal dialogue impossible , reinforcing the extremists , and heightening the probability that violent conflicts will occur .
In addition , the research institute believes that the extensive domestic and international media attention to Hungarian Guard actions has " significantly damaged Hungary 's international image , particularly as regards belief in the stability of the country and in the sophistication of its democracy . "
They point out that the increasing publicity and impetus given to the re-organization of radical and far right groups in Hungary starting in the autumn of 2006 have been part of the reason why a number of organizations calling themselves " national self-defence " alliances were established starting in the summer of 2007 .
" The common feature of these groups is that they call themselves civic organizations while openly declaring that they are preparing their members for defensive - including armed - tasks ( citing disaster management , national defence , law enforcement ) while declaring that the police and armed forces , in other words , the government , is unsuited for the role , " Political Capital adds .
They noted that all of these moves have been made within a configuration that relies on society 's anti-politics and anti-political-party mood to cloak various political ambitions under a mantle of civic action .
In other words , their emphasis on the civic nature of their actions and their choice of the association as their organizational form are not merely ruses to sidestep legal pitfalls to registration with the courts , but are also part of a political strategy .
According to the analysis , the activity of the Hungarian Guard is heightening the risk of damaging our relations with our neighbours , too .
" In recent months several of Hungary 's neighbours have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential hazard . The ultranationalist political players among some of these neighbours have referred to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard as an argument to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies .
All of these factors influence the political stability of the region , " it adds .
The research institute notes that the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe , and as such it heightens the political risk for the whole of the region .
It notes that the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard , established in August 2007 by the far right Bulgarian National Union . ( BNU ) .
Serious conflicts that broke out between Roma and non-Roma in a Sofia district ( Krasna Polyana ) were behind the establishment of the Bulgarian guard .
BNU took advantage of the disturbances to establish its guard , claiming that the goal of the organization was " national self-defence . "
They argued that during the past 17 years Bulgaria had been subject to " Gypsy terror , " in which the government was helpless and indifferent , Political Capital noted .
The initiative triggered heated debate among the Bulgarian public , it added .
One sign that the risk of ethnic conflict has increased , the analysts wrote , is that some Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced plans to establish a guard of their own as a resistance force .
Since the Hungarian Guard has so far acted quite similarly to the Bulgarian National Guard , it is quite possible that the Roma community of Hungary could respond to the threat by organizing their own self-defence , wrote Political Capital in warning of the risk .
Political Capital research manager Attila Juhász responded to a query from the MTI Hungarian wire service by saying that risk analysis was one of the research institute 's chief activities .
Each year , he said , they publish risk analyses , and if they discover any factor that might alter risks , they notify public opinion by publishing a risk warning , as they have now done .
The Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi : Melting Prejudices
To tell the truth , I have never rooted for Peugeot 206 too much .
Its handling characteristics have not been anything special , the quality of gear control , driving control and construction could occasionally have been labelled as mediocre .
But now there is its successor , the Peugeot 207 on the market , and it is far better .
And the station wagon called SW goes even a step further and I cannot help but to give it another thought .
When I was testing the classical Peugeot 207 hatchback , I complained for example about the headroom in the back seat .
Here the complaints are over , because the station wagon 's body means that not even two-meter tall giants will suffer in this respect .
At a Glance
I will pass through the interior quickly , so as not to repeat myself too much .
We have quite an excellent design here , where the only critique I have is the meagre central tunnel .
I would appreciate some more designer inventiveness here , as the car itself looks so elegant .
The seats are comfortable and the times when we could have complained about short seats or seat backs are truly behind us .
Also , the lateral seat support has improved markedly in comparison with the 206 model .
Considering the space , we can feel the build-up in the car body dimensions as well .
In the station , then , the already mentioned lack of headroom disappears .
Suitcases into the Trunk
So the main thing about this car is its trunk .
I must evaluate it as very well accessible ( thanks also to the hinged quarter window ) and fairly spacious .
The blind spots are equipped with retaining elastics , which are an ideal compromise .
It doesn 't block space , it can be dilated and yet it holds even heavier objects .
But let us pause to observe the volume .
According to the tables it is in 428 l the basic arrangement , which , compared to its competitors , is rather average .
But not in comparison with the best selling car of this class in Bohemia - the Skoda Fabia Station Wagon .
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mladá Boleslav products , we will see that the Peugeot lags highly noticeable 52 litres behind .
For vacations in foreign countries or with a baby-carriage load , this number is almost critical .
Though if I were to accent the positive points , I would have to mention the absolutely flat surface when turning down the seat backs in the second row or the very low threshold .
120 Horses in Four Rows
The tested wagon was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with 1.6 l capacity and 88kW power .
And to tell the truth , this is how a 1600 which powers a family hatchback should look .
It is quiet , it has low expenditure , and above all it really moves .
If I compare it to the Skoda equivalent , which sometimes makes you feel like it has a rag stuck in the exhaust , I cannot help but be delighted .
The Hint is in the Price
The car 's price is not cheap .
Nevertheless , we shall bear in mind that we have tested a fairly equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine .
The basic price of the car with a 1.6 petrol engine of 329,900 Czech crowns is not that bad .
Our assembly costs a minimum of 410,900 , which is pretty much already .
The tested equipment Premium will include equipment worth some 80 , 000 Czech crowns more .
But besides , we had the head airbags , the automatic air-condition , the automatic screen-wiper activation , the electric rear-window control ...
The car simply costs 531,900 Czech crowns all in all .
This is quite a bit , but if you consider the additional equipment of Fabia , you will get a very similar number .
So there 's nothing else to do but to choose based on the brand-name .
Cuba the Most Beautiful Island of the Caribbean
For its visitors it is really an island of freedom .
Whatever you expect from your vacations , it can happen if you make the right choice .
Golden and lily-white beaches , high waves or a sea calm as a pond .
Palm trees and the full board with waiters offering pizza , ice-cream or potent shakes on the beach .
Kite-surfing , golf and roulette .
You will find a full and even richer list of all this on the islands in the Caribbean Sea .
But there is just one island where you find much more , and that island is Cuba , the biggest and most beautiful of the West Indies .
Under the reign of Spaniards , Cuba was the stronghold of their American conquest .
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a man 's eye had ever seen .
Havana became a storage and transfer centre for the treasures the Spaniards had stolen in America and transferred to Europe .
And then the American era came .
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 1920s .
Its building was initiated by one of the bosses of the American Mafia , Lucky Luciano , because all that was illegal in the U.S. ( especially during the prohibition ) was welcome and supported in Cuba , drugs , gambling , prostitution .
Among his guests were , among others ,
Winston Churchill , Ava Gardner , Frank Sinatra .
High-rises were built in Havana , and the cars which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s drove on the wide avenues .
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula , not far from Havana , and he had a yacht in Cojímar .
The movie stars and politicians from all over America were leaving their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio .
What about today ?
Even you can leave your autograph on the walls in the Havana Bodeguita .
They will mix a shake according to your wishes in the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional .
And the cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around Havana ever since , because the once imported Zhiguli and Fiat vehicles have decayed in the salty and damp weather .
Though Havana , particularly its oldest part , is significantly squalid , nowhere else in the surroundings is there such a great number of fabulous colonial sights .
Other places have also been transformed into beauty , e.g. Trinidad .
With respect to the fact that tourism brings in badly needed money , its development has the green light .
In the last 15 years , new hotels were built not only in Havana , but in particular in Varadero , on the Holguín coast and on small islands such as Cayo Coco , Cayo Guillermo and others .
Cuba offers one more rarity which is unique in the world , of special value to train lovers .
Sugar cane from the vast plantations was transported to the sugar mills on narrow rails by a small steam locomotive and motor trains .
Their wagon stock has not been renewed for dozens of years and so you can see functional trains there whose contemporaries elsewhere are now only in museums .
Where to go ?
Most visitors to Cuba will not miss the best known spots .
And so there is no need to get into much detail about Varadero or Havana .
Perhaps just to mention that there is a museum in the Hemingway homestead mentioned above and those who like this author should not miss the visit .
The Viňales Valley The Viňales Valley in the western part of the island is one of the most picturesque spots in Cuba .
Lush vegetation grows out of the limestone bedrock .
Mogotes , limestone round-topped mountains and rocks rise up steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has taken hold in the cavities , thanks to which even the dilapidated rocks are covered with thick overgrowth .
The valley is a place where probably the extra-best Cuban tobacco is grown .
You can encounter its final shape if you visit one of the Havana factories for cigar making .
The fact that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there may also be of interest to some .
Trinidad
An ancient city which was established shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island .
Fame and fortune were brought there with the slave and sugar trades .
Fortune transformed into beauty and the imposing architecture of the small city .
The colonial Spanish architecture , deeply influenced by the later French colonists , has not changed much during four centuries .
Trinidad , between the sea and the Escambray mountain range , is a place so remote that even as late as in the 1950s there was still no road to connect the area to the rest of the country .
The isolation helped it remain apart from it .
Nothing was being built there , therefore nothing was being torn down either , everybody was glad to have a roof over their head .
If you have more time for Trinidad than just one afternoon , other interesting places in the neighbourhood are worth seeing as well , like the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugarmill Valley .
In the evening , it is appropriate go to Casa de la Música , which becomes full of life at nightfall and the music abates there at dawn .
Baracoa
A tiny town easternmost end of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful one on the island .
This opinion is certainly influenced by the road leading there itself .
Both roads leading there from Guantanámo must pass through high and rugged mountains and they go through natural surroundings nearly untouched by human activity .
Thanks to its inviolate nature , the eastern cape of Cuba has been placed by UNESCO onto the World Heritage List .
They make the best chocolate there , they have a Columbus cross in a church ( which was actually created about one hundred years after Columbus 's voyage ) and from the hill where the former castle and what today is the hotel El Castillo stands , you can see several mesas , of which El Yunque is the most famous .
You can fill many pages writing about it all : the coffee , rum , cigars , the Sierra Maestra mountain range , the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos , the Tropicana cabaret , the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre , Santería , and African religions , which are professed by the descendants of former slaves .
But , as the veritable saying goes , better to see it once .
Not Down and Out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 airplane , fitted with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles , starts at $ 54 million .
But that is small change to some of the Russian rich .
" It seats up to 18 passengers , " said Dan Firer , a Gulfstream representative .
" But none of them ask for that many seats because it is for a private family or a company president . "
Mr. Firer was manning the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair , a four-day orgy of conspicuous consumption held at a cavernous exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital .
In addition to Gulfstream , over 200 other luxury purveyors had set up display stands , hoping to interest newly moneyed Russians in everything from mahogany-panelled yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles worthy of 50 Cent .
Mr. Firer warily eyed a bright orange Porsche at the booth next to his .
" That 's a nice car , but it is nickels and dimes compared to us , " he said .
" After the United States , Russia is the second-biggest market for private aircraft . "
Fueled by an oil boom , the Russian capital seems as awash in cash as Dallas was in its heyday .
" We went through the same thing in the 1890s when some Americans came into giant wealth and flocked to Europe , where they were viewed as materialistic , " said Marshall Goldman , a senior scholar at the Davis Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University .
Like the Saudi high rollers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s , Russians are emerging as the world 's most visible free spenders .
The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share of the Klondike .
Elsewhere in Moscow this week , a conference on the luxury industry has drawn Donatella Versace , Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault , the chairman of LVMH , to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods to markets like Russia .
( The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune , which is owned by The New York Times Company . )
Russia has 53 billionaires worth a total of $ 282 billion , according to the Forbes list of the richest people .
In addition , the second-tier rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires who are collectively worth $ 670 billion , according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research , a think tank here .
( The World Bank says that in 2005 , 15.8 percent of Russians lived below subsistence level . )
" There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that is why we are all here , " said Nicole Marais , a sales and marketing representative for David Morris , the London jeweller .
She was attending the fair for the first time in conjunction with the brand 's Russian distributor , the Soho Jewelry Group .
" The women are all impeccably groomed and the men are all worth a fortune . "
Wandering the halls Sunday night , dressed in evening attire , two real estate agents , Evgenia Yumatova , 21 , and Svetlana Turovtsova , 26 , described both themselves and their clients as millionaires .
" I was looking at the cars and I 'm trying to decide between the Infiniti , the Mercedes and the Porsche , " said Ms. Yumatova , who reeled off the designer clothing she was wearing like a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers .
The fair seemed primarily aimed at the nouveaux riches , the type of brand-driven Russian shoppers who would be willing to sit through several hours of traffic to tour a drafty warehouse that gaudily juxtaposed Cadillac Escalades , platinum penknives , Mövenpick ice cream , custom pool tables , apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears .
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ( $ 44.57 ) .
" Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best , " said Mr. Gijrath , who was sitting patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft , in front of a wall-size re-creation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue tile .
" Of course , Russians are more interested in bling-bling . "
Indeed , vendors here said that Russians with old money ( 10 to 15 years is old , by Russian standards ) have already moved on from flashy logos to the kind of understated limited-edition brands that would not market themselves at a trade show .
Still , several thousand people , whether cash millionaires , emissaries of millionaires or just tourists , thronged the halls every day .
And some of them were buying .
On the first night of the show last Thursday , Roman Ershov , the general manager of King Koil beds here , said he had sold two $ 70,000 mattress sets made of silk , cashmere and cotton , interwoven with gold threads .
Also on the first night , Mikhail Lyubiumov , the sales manager for A1 Moto , a company that outfits high-end cars with high-end alarm systems , said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche , for $ 170,000 , to a Russian millionaire .
By Sunday afternoon , Andrei Karapetian , the president of L.A. Connection , a company that customizes luxury cars , said he had sold three car grilles , resembling interlinked chain bracelets , for Rolls-Royce Phantoms , at $ 55,000 each .
He showed a reporter a car wheel , designed for a Russian casino owner , with spokes that he had encrusted with coloured Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel .
The cost : $ 22,000 for a set of four .
" The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife 's face made out of cubic zirconium , is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels , " Mr. Karapetian said .
" He is going to keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage . "
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich , Mr. Karapetian said the phrase " Russian millionaire " did not convey much exclusivity at the moment , given the surge in real estate prices here .
" If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago , you are probably already a millionaire , at least on paper if not in cash , " he said .
" There are more of them than you think . "
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand run by Alliance Continental , a Russian asset management firm .
The company had erected four red British-style telephone booths , stuffed with piles of counterfeit million-dollar greenbacks .
Azad Karryev , the company 's marketing manager , said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair .
Passers-by stopped to toss piles of money around , ask their friends to snap cellphone images of them reclining amid ersatz wealth , or just to pocket a couple of million .
" You see , in Moscow , everyone can feel himself a millionaire , " Mr. Karryev said .
Forces for a huge strike come together
On Friday , the Liga Unions and the National Federation of Workers ' Councils ( MOSZ ) will put together a strike committee charged with coordinating an open-ended strike set to start on Monday .
They plan to hold a protest rally on Saturday and on Monday - the day parliament is scheduled to vote a health insurance bill into law - they will begin their work stoppage .
The strike is certain to snarl the transport network , for rail traffic will come to a more or less complete halt and Budapest public transport will be frozen until 1.00 p.m ..
Liga and the Workers ' Council federation will publicize details of their jointly organized Monday walkout on Friday afternoon .
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is being set up to coordinate Monday 's industrial action .
Organizers plan to hold a public protest demonstration on Saturday , and the organizations joining the strike will begin an open-ended work stoppage on Monday unless they can come to prior agreement with the government .
What this means is that they have not set a termination date for the walkout , beginning as of the day parliament adopts the health insurance bill .
If by some chance parliament fails to adopt the health insurance law , the unions will immediately retract their strike appeal .
If they adopt the bill , the strike committees will meet and decide on their next moves .
Given parliament 's agenda for Monday , it is conceivable that the health insurance bill may not come up for a vote until evening or possibly not until late at night .
The strike that gets underway on Monday is certain to create significant delays in the transport system . The railways will stop running for an open-ended period of time , while a portion of Budapest public transport might be halted through noon , as might over half of the long-distance bus lines .
At the same time , there will be partial roadblocks on many of the nation 's highways .
Many unions and civic organizations have responded to the strike appeal . A complete and regularly updated list of them is available on Liga 's website .
Some organizations have announced open-ended strikes , while others are limiting themselves to temporary work stoppages .
As of Thursday afternoon no agreement had been reached between Hungarian railways MÁV and the Railway Workers ' Free Trade Union ( VDSZSZ ) , not even on minimum services , despite the fact that a growing number of people plan to travel by rail as the Christmas holidays approach ..
According to latest reports , the Budapest Transport Company will be out from the start of business till 1 p.m. , Budapest Airport will halt work from 7 to 9 a.m. , Liga 's Power and Thermal Energy Unions will walk off the job for 4 hours , while the Teachers ' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers will hold 2-hours and 2-8 hour walkouts .
The National Federation of Physicians will hold a nationwide strike over staggered hours while the Democratic Union of Healthcare and Welfare Workers ( EDDSZ ) , a part of the umbrella Union Cooperation Forum ( SZEF ) , plans a two-hour warning strike .
The most important of Liga 's four demands is that the government repeal its health insurance reform bill and submit a new concept for society-wide debate .
The second demand is that the new method for calculating pensions due to begin next year be introduced gradually instead of all at once .
The third is that when determining the occupations eligible for early retirement , the jobs to be included in the option be chosen before 2010 .
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Railway Workers ' Free Trade Union ( VDSZSZ ) , a Liga union , rejected the offer submitted by the Economic and Transport Ministry on spur lines and wants it to make a new offer .
Raffle tickets and savoury scones dominate ministry Christmas party
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth appears not to have a sensitive side : she is holding an end-year staff conference instead of a Christmas party , though coffee and savoury scones will be served .
Other ministries plan parties with live bands , while still others are giving out raffle tickets and a glass or two of Christmas spirits to enhance the mood and find a way into the hearts of staff .
Celebrations , Christmas spirit , concerts and smorgasbord - how the powerful party .
Government offices also get ready for Christmas .
This year the defence ministry is planning the biggest ministry Christmas party , but the guests won 't be ministry staffers .
It 's Orphans ' Christmas will have gifts for the children of soldiers killed while serving , it 's Mission Christmas will invite the families of soldiers currently serving in international missions , and its press reception will be for the media .
The ministry plans on spending 25 million for year-end mood enhancement .
The National Development Agency ( NFÜ ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport ( GKM ) are kicking up their heels and partying more ardently than the other government offices .
GKM is holding its party at the House of the Future , and spending HUF 4,320,000 on the package for about 350 of its 600 staff members .
It is focusing on creating a true Christmas atmosphere , and will have live performers and a raffle with prizes .
NFÜ spent 4,700,000 forints on its Christmas cheer , holding its celebration at the headquarters of the National Justice Administration Council ( OIT ) on Wednesday . It is offering guests a series of concert performances and dinner .
The hall rental cost one million forints , and the rest went on the more than four hundred invited guests .
We have been told that one division within NFÜ has been invited to another Christmas party , too : a bid management company , the Hungarian Economic Development Centre ( MAG Zrt ) , will be celebrating with EU money .
It rented out the entire Vígszínház theatre for the event .
MAG Zrt did not confirm this , as we were unable to find anyone in charge .
Informal dress is fine
OIT headquarters played host not only to NFÜ but also to the Justice and Law Enforcement Ministry , which decided to hold a Lucia Day ball on December 7 , instead of a Christmas party .
OIT did not charge this group for use of its building .
About 500 people attended the ball .
The party got underway with a toast by the minister , and after the dinner there was dancing to live music .
When questioned [ by origo ] they said that formal dress was not mandatory for either women or men .
The ministries of health , labour and local government organized more puritan dances .
The health ministry ran a celebration for its staff at its own headquarters , spending 400,000 forints on the event .
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth didn 't even call it a Christmas party , just a year-end staff conference .
The ministry expects 180 guests , said its media department , who will be offered only coffee and savoury scones to stay within a budget of HUF 350.000 .
Local Government Minister Gordon Bajnai plans only to drink a simple toast with staff in the assembly hall of the Ministry for Local Government and Regional Development .
The finance ministry ( PM ) is holding a Christmas gathering in its own assembly hall and has invited 436 staff members .
It plans to spend HUF 2,500 per guest for the Christmas party , which will include a smorgasbord buffet and one toast per person .
PM workers have welcomed Christmas in this fashion every year since János Veres became minister .
People don 't actually plan to party - the mood will remain official , thanks partly to the minister who intends to make a speech , and partly to the timing - it will be in the afternoon .
The farm ministry is holding off for a New Year 's reception , which will be on January 20 , so there won 't be any Christmas celebration .
Its reception will be at a Vajdahunyad castle in the City Park , and the ministry reported that it plans to spend 1,000 forints per guest , for 100 guests .
The media department underlined that it was offering a very simple buffet meal , to which it was inviting only the professional diplomats accredited to Hungary .
The reception , a repeat of one held annually for some time now , will again begin with a brief greeting from the minister and end with just a bit of snacking .
The foreign and education ministries do not intend to hold any Christmas parties at all , the media departments told Origo .
The environment ministry was unable to tell us the cost of its office Christmas .
At any rate , it has invited over 400 guests to a party it plans to hold at the Museum of Applied Arts .
UK uses YouTube as military recruiting tool
British military units have been sharing their Iraqi and Afghanistani actions through video clips on You Tube in an effort to popularize their missions .
The Royal Air Force ( RAF ) was the first to develop a taste for YouTube : its special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading video clips showing how they have been combating the Taliban since March 2006 , BBC reports .
The images , taken with miniature cameras attached to troop helmets , are monitored by a command centre in Kandahar and then transferred to London from where they are uploaded onto the Internet .
There 's no mistaking the political message
Fully 139 RAF images have been uploaded onto the Internet and so far over they have received over 75,000 hits .
The UK defence ministry has been registered since spring 2007 as " defence headquarters , " regularly uploading video clips on Iraqi and Afghanistani actions , while the Commonwealth Office and the Multinational Force - Iraq ( MNF-I ) have their own You Tube channels .
Introduction to Afghanistan
The RAF originally uploaded the videos as a recruitment tool . The defence ministry says they have also been a good way to let the public know the real purpose of keeping the forces abroad .
Publicity disseminated through this avenue costs almost nothing when compared to traditional recruitment commercials on television , defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told BBC . At the same time , they inadvertently carry a bit of a political message for , in a special way , they offer insight into the reasons why the government ordered the ongoing military actions .
The Americans have turned it into a game
A problem the military has to contend with involves the amateur videos being shared alongside the carefully edited and censured official clips , which sometimes even show dying soldiers . In the slightly hypocritical " official " clips , officers will at most talk about their losses but the bloody side of the fighting is never actually shown .
Quite a number of videos from the Iraqi and Afghanistani battlefields showing live action have been posted on the Internet , but British forces have only recently joined in the postings .

Venus Is Earth 's Hellish Twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere , Venus is more similar to Earth than anticipated : European space probe " Venus Express " discovered lightning in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles , similar to those occurring on Earth in winter .
For almost three decades , scientists suspected the existence of lightning on Venus .
Now , the European probe " Venus Express " brings confirmation - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere : On Venus , lightning is leaping from cloud to cloud in a height of 56 kilometres , reports Christopher Russel of the University of California , Los Angeles , in the science magazine " Nature . "
According to the famous " primordial soup theory , " life on Earth was conditioned by lightning : Supposedly , thunderstorms prompted reactions in the ocean which in turn led to the creation of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
Not so on Venus : " If life ever existed there , it had to have been in the planet 's very early history , " explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution , Washington .
Today , chances of life existing on the surface of Venus are slim : The atmosphere is about one hundred times denser than on Earth , with temperatures of up to 500 degrees .
" Venus may be a devilish twin of Earth , but a twin it is , " Russel said .
The key question of the ESA mission is why Venus , which is so similar to Earth in terms of mass and size , has undergone such a fundamentally different evolution .
The launch of " Venus Express " in November 2005 marked a milestone for Venus research . There had been no probe specifically designed to explore the planet since the early nineties .
The latest research results are now being presented in several " Nature " articles . According to the scientists , they do not just emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system .
" They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and Earth are greater than initially anticipated , " ESA reports .
In addition to the known whirlwind at the North Pole , for instance , the researchers discovered a whirl of clouds at the South Pole , spinning at a significantly higher velocity .
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in Earth 's winter hemisphere , writes a research team of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica .
The mass of the solar system 's second-innermost planet is almost the same as that of Earth , as is its size , with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres .
The planet , which is also known as morning star or evening star , orbits the sun in just under 225 days .
Its rotation is much slower , however : One Venus day equals 243 Earth days .
With surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar , Venus barely resembles Earth . Nonetheless , scientists suspect that both planets developed under very similar conditions .
Water accumulated on both planets . On Earth it remained in oceans , whereas on Venus it escaped into space .
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is focused in carbonate rock , on Venus it makes up the bulk of the atmosphere .
England faced with judgment call over the claims of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas , each almost as difficult as the other .
Who should bat at No 6 for England in Kandy this weekend , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara ?
And , no less relevant in a wider context than the first Test against Sri Lanka , who should make the decision ?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney , the chairman of selectors who is on borrowed time under that particular title at least , is here to help Peter Moores , the head coach , and Michael Vaughan , the captain , to decide and because the desk of Hugh Morris , the England managing director , is starting to fill up with applications to become national selector , if not a part-time one .
Whoever does not get the sixth batting place will be unlucky , but life is often unfair and sport certainly is .
It is never easy to pin down what makes one man reach the top of his profession while another never gets beyond a lower level , sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability .
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult , requiring judgment that always has to be subjective in the end .
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up ?
Is it fair on Shah if he does ?
The same might well be asked in another field of whether , say , John Edwards or " Tubby " Banerjee , both bright young executives with good degrees who know the business well , should be promoted to the board : there is only room for one of them .
Who is to say what the right level is for a cricketer , unless he is given the chance to sink or swim at the next one ?
Figures , naturally , have a large bearing on decisions , but so do opportunities .
Within a team , a cricketer has to catch the captain 's eye at the right time if he is to take a wicket and a batsman has to get regular chances up the order if he is to make an impact as a one-day cricketer .
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated .
There were many who did better last season , for example , than James Anderson , who looks certain to play in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself fit and bowls like the wind in the nets .
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each to earn a place on this tour .
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same modest average , but both have had their moments at the highest level and hope for more of them .
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya Stadium can be only a matter of opinion .
The choice might break or make either man 's career , or it might make little difference .
Four years ago in Sri Lanka , Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first , with five wickets and 40 useful runs , but it was Paul Collingwood , struggling to establish himself at the same time , who came through to become a substantial Test cricketer and , despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia , may still be underestimated .
The probability is that Graveney , Vaughan and Moores , after one more discussion in the wake of today 's net session at the Asgiriya Stadium , will follow their conservative instincts and plump for Shah 's greater experience over Bopara 's youthful exuberance .
There are arguments for both .
In Shah 's favour are his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings of 88 in Bombay , 32 first-class hundreds to only six by Bopara , who , at 22 , is seven years younger , and an excellent record against spin bowling .
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord 's , his home venue as a Middlesex player , and that , plus the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan was fit to reclaim his place for the next match , seems to have taken from his batting some of the élan that was evident in Bombay .
By contrast , the Essex all-rounder has joie de vivre in spades .
He is fazed by nothing on a cricket field and his attitude off it was summed up when he recently overturned a four-wheel-drive vehicle at an exhibition day for England 's car sponsor , Volkswagen .
He suffered minor injuries and , presumably , shock , but the first thing that he did was to pull out his Vodafone ( also sponsored , of course ) and phone Alastair Cook , his team-mate , who was watching from a distance , to say , with excitement : " Did you see that ? "
Bopara is much the better fielder , he is bowling his skiddy medium pace to some effect here on pitches that seem to suit him and is batting with confidence and skill .
Choosing the right man is one thing , choosing the right moment another .
Perhaps that is the real art of selection .
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance now , which is not to say that Shah might not excel if , as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest , it is he who plays here this weekend .
The Fathers of Krautrock Are Back
Germany 's super group of the seventies is reunited : At a concert in Berlin , the three band members of Harmonia once again grabbed their mixing consoles .
To celebrate the reunion , " Live 1974 , " a recording from their heyday , is released .
Even back then , they were much more famous abroad than in Germany .
The arranged sensation , then , occurs in the shape of three composed gentlemen at the dinner table .
Each of them has his little box in front of them , his wires and , most significantly , his keys .
Dieter Moebius , 63 , wearing a pristine white shirt , is throning at the centre .
At his left flank is Michael Rother , a paltry 57 , wielding a laptop computer and a guitar .
And at the right , from the auditorium 's point of view , Hans-Joachim Roedelius , 73 , is bent over a mixing console in concentration .
Each of them is contributing noises , sometimes even a beat .
And once in a while , it inadvertently fuses into a conventional piece of music .
The gentlemen themselves do not seem overly bothered when it does , either .
The band Harmonia 's reunion has caused some excitement among Krautrock aficionados .
Although , it may be disclosed here : Specific inquiries uncovered that while the name was buzzing through collective pop memory , it was not so forcefully as to have this band being sorely missed for 32 years .
But why should Germans not be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the seventies , too ?
Especially given that what is misleadingly called Krautrock had always been held in more esteem in England or America than at home .
When the music industry gave an Echo Honorary Award to the survivors of Cologne group Can in 2003 , quite a few quizzical German pop faces were to be seen in the room .
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers proceeded to thank the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu ! in their panegyric , the bewilderment knew no bounds .
At shows later on , Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers , like an old pal .
The problem with the ignorance at home and a misty-eyed view abroad is one thing .
Harmonia overtaxes the brain for the simple reason that the trio existed for two years only , making much less of an impression in that period than others would attest in hindsight .
Moebius and Roedelius had earlier collaborated with artist Conrad Schnitzler , under the promising name Cluster .
Initially , they played in the basement of the Schaubühne in Berlin .
After that , for economical reasons , for a record label owned by the church , in Düsseldorf .
Rother had briefly helped out Kraftwerk , and had subsequently made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu ! , at the time perhaps the most radical German group .
Around 1973 , however , Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile , to Forst , in the Weser Highland .
There , at the Alte Weserhof , an old ruin dating to the 16th century , they lived as communards , away from the cities .
Less ideologically than at Kommune I , where Roedelius had once laboured as a nanny .
But rather living the Spitzwegian life of an artist .
Allegedly , a banneret of the Glee Club Harmonia Ottenstein was found amid some scrap , and thus , a name for their art .
Quite a bit of that was documented by Harmonia .
The first album was called " Musik von Harmonia , " the next one " De Luxe . "
Because , as relaxed and modest as the music may have sounded , the band was in great need , materially .
The brushwood collecting was not just for self-discovery purposes .
The newly released CD " Live 1974 " was recorded at a concert in Griessem , in front of a record audience of 50 , as somebody seems to recall .
It was Rother , back then , who wanted to push Harmonia and practice occasionally .
For Roedelius and Moebius , it was an unethical proposition .
The band declared its split in 1975 .
Rother ended up in the esoteric-spherical field and earned his livelihood with albums such as " Flammende Herzen . "
Cluster became fashionable again in the eighties , and went on to be more successful than Harmonia ever was .
The Griessem live album is owed to Herbert Grönemeyer .
His record label Grönland aims to preserve Krautrock as Germany 's own distinct contribution to lively music .
Neu ! has already been exhumed in the process , as has Roedelius " solo work .
The in-the-flesh resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berlin House of Cultures of the World .
Publicly funded , as part of the Worldtronics Festival .
Julian Cope is there , Brit , former punk and author of the handbook " Krautrock Sampler . "
So is Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte .
Which offers a sketch of the whole range of influence Krautrock had on subsequent pop music .
Harmonia 's part is to fill the gap of the supergroup .
Along with the idiosyncratic sound , Brian Eno 's dictum is hovering in the room : " The only true music , the future belongs to it . "
Images of the producer , in a farmhouse room with Harmonia , appear .
Projections of further black-and-white photos showing woozily wired machinery do their part in the making of a legend .
In front of it all , the three veterans are once again improvising .
No longer by sticking microphones to organ and drums in order to get the instruments to produce unheard sounds via the self-made effects devices .
Today , electronic music looks like electronic music .
Three tinkerers preoccupied with technical aspects .
Even the resident choir doesn 't change that .
Directed by Barbara Morgenstern , there is coughing and whispering beneath clouds of sound , and , at one beautiful point , " Aaaaaaaah ! " is sung , with emphasis .
Krautrock , after all , has always been a very English term .
It never was rock .
The roots were to be found less in blues than at conservatories ( Can ) , in technologies ( Kraftwerk ) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions ( Cluster ) .
Those now exclaiming " " 68 ! " are not entirely wrong , but , even now , Harmonia still don 't lose their cool over it .
On the stage , even the most self-evident things are considered most thoroughly .
Where does music start , and when does it end ?
It can wreck your nerves , or it can grant fleeting moments of great happiness .
Richard Gere Just Isn 't Cynical Enough
" The Hunting Party " and " Mörderischer Frieden " make two more films dealing with the Balkan War .
But neither of them is convincing .
Either the concepts put too much emphasis on action sequences and gunfire , or they are too maudlin .
Even Richard Gere , in " The Hunting Party , " can 't change that .
The good news first : War criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the Balkan mountains . But right there , of all places , in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war , the actor Richard Gere has now been recovered .
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties lately , after all too many nicely trivial roles in feel-good films for women and all too many press conferences on Buddhism had exorcised any desire to watch him .
Now , suddenly , Richard Gere is the best reason why we would maybe want to watch " The Hunting Party , " after all . ( The full German title is " The Hunting Party - Wenn der Jäger zum Gejagten wird " - why do film titles always have to be as long and dizzying over here as labour agreements for engine drivers ? )
His performance is delightfully tongue-in-cheek . Essentially , his war reporter Simon Hunt is who Gere could have ended up as , had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him : A man whose heyday is long past , but who has preserved considerable shreds of his former charm even as a ruin-like monument .
Still , despite this trump card , " The Hunting Party , " along with the German production " Mörderischer Frieden , " which also debuts this week , merely continues the endless line of failed Balkan War movies .
" Mörderischer Frieden " can be dealt with fairly quickly : The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo ( Adrian Topol , Max Riemelt ) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovan snipers - and one of whom promptly falls in love with her , to boot .
Although the fact that the Serbs , for once , aren 't portrayed as the sole root of all evil here is to be appreciated , the film , in its TV-like shallowness , quickly gets lost in gunfire and action sequences .
What remains is something like the German car-chase TV show " Alarm für Cobra 11 , " only with war taking the place of the autobahn .
" The Hunting Party , " meanwhile , is kind of like exhibit A in the investigation on why there 's actually never been a really good Balkan War movie .
With another director and another screenwriter ( Richard Shepard is both ) , and at another time , the story of three US war reporters committed to track down Serbian war criminal supreme " The Fox " might have ended up becoming a new " Apocalypse Now . "
The stories , after all , are strikingly similar : In both , small teams enter the woods to accomplish something the military couldn 't , and in both , the result is a journey into madness .
One of the reasons why " The Hunting Party " fails is that Simon Hunt isn 't allowed to simply be the run-down cynic with a heart of gold we 're introduced to at the beginning .
No , the script also has to saddle him with a romantic relationship on top of that , with a Bosnian muslim woman who is killed later on .
" The Hunting Party " goes off the rails altogether when the reporters , in fast-forward motion , achieve in the last five minutes what NATO , CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world haven 't been able to achieve in five years : To catch the war criminal and leave him to the just revenge of the Bosnian muslims .
This is so bad , it makes you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the grounds of crimes against cinematic logic .
The film 's concern , however , is actually a deeply human one .
It wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free as they please , and it suspects the Americans and the French ( apparently they agree here , for once ) of not being overly concerned with their pursuit due to secret political horse-trading .
But good intentions and evil are so similar sometimes that a popular poem by Brecht comes to mind .
In it , the wooden mask of an Asian demon resting on the poet 's working desk is described : " With sympathy I regard the swollen veins on the forehead , suggesting : how hard it is , to be evil . "
Films like " The Hunting Party " have those very same swollen heads , in that case suggesting , however , how hard it is , to be good .
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War movie .
Recently , it was reported in this paper that all Hollywood Iraq movies have utterly bombed .
One could add : There has never been a good South Africa movie , either .
Rule of thumb : If some star actor is running around in the hot spots or on the minefields of the world , the result is something like " Rangoon , " with Patricia Arquette , " Beyond Borders , " with Angelina Jolie , or " Blood Diamond , " with Leonardo DiCaprio .
Possibly , all of these conflicts are simply too recent .
After all , decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to direct a good Holocaust movie in " Schindler 's List . "
Some film or other may still mature - the Vietnam works " The Deer Hunter , " " Apocalypse Now " or " Full Metal Jacket , " now considered to be classics , were not exactly celebrated unanimously as masterworks at the time , after all .
Or maybe we just know too much about the violent conflicts of the world nowadays , with every instance of mass murder appearing at our homes in real time and on two screens simultaneously .
And that robs screenwriters of the recklessness required to tell good stories .
Part of the reason why " To Be or Not to Be " or " The Great Dictator " are such good films , after all , is that Lubitsch and Chaplin didn 't yet know how bad the Nazi regime 's reign really was .
To be able to make good films , perhaps one must not want to be good .
Perhaps a sarcastically distanced artistic view like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk 's is required .
Queried on the parallels between his historical novel " Lemprière 's Dictionary " and the Balkan War , he replied : " That 's just because some things never change .
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous , people will always be murdered in gruesome ways , and there will always be war in Yugoslavia . "
Mp3 players under accusation , they put hearing at risk
Listening to music at high volume for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players could cause permanent lesions to hearing .
This is what a European Commission reports , which in a communication released in Brussels cites the advice given by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks ( SCENIHR ) of the EU , published today .
" From this scientific advice - the note reads - emerges that 5- 10 % of those that , for a period of at least 5 years , listen to music using portable musical players weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability . "
" It worries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical players and cellular phones at very high volume may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way , " declares Meglena Kuneva .
" From the scientific findings - carries on the EU spokesperson - a clear risk emerges and we have to react rapidly .
What counts most , we need to sensitize consumers and make this information available to the public .
Besides , in light of this scientific advice , we have to re-examine existent control systems to make sure that they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology . "
Brussels had asked the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem , seeing the widespread use of portable musical players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate .
" Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there are reasons for concern and the European Commission will now examine , together with member states and other interested parties , what measures can be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise coming portable musical players and related equipment . "
Currently , a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musical players to 100 dB , but concerns regarding hearing damage caused by an excessive exposure to such noise sources , are increasing .
It is possible to considerably limit the damage by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of level and duration of the noise exposure .
In its opinion , the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical players listen to music at high volume ( &gt; 89 dB ) for only 5 hours per week , they are already over the permissible maximum noise limits currently in place for the workplace .
People who listen to music under such conditions for longer durations risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period .
This is the case for 5-10 % of users of such devices and their number can be quantified to between 2.5 and 10 million people within the EU .
USA , the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists : in the newspapers it is time for cuts . And many blame the internet , " killer " of the printed paper .
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Centre what they think of the state of their profession and mental control as regards to the future .
Well , nowadays journalists are almost all of them pessimistic regarding their future .
Yet , to the information clerks , they have not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility .
They don 't feel as isolated as they used to .
The problem for American journalists is the money , the money .
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model .
Furthermore the cuts carried out in the newsroom , the office where editors work to assemble the newspaper , are a big problem .
It 's a problem that needs to be resolved , according to the journalists interviewed , if we do not want that traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is substantially diminished .
A clear but complex pessimism nowadays pervades American journalists .
Six out of ten journalists of the printed press and senior executives are convinced that journalism at a national level is going down the wrong road .
Within the local field the executive group is 65 % .
Printed against broadcast .
It 's not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going .
The major publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves towards the internet , by many seen as the " assassin " of the printed paper .
The " economic pressure " that journalists have felt has increased up to 79 % .
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology hoping that it " will do some good " for their journalism .
The biggest rift in American journalism nowadays is between those who manage the newsrooms - that is the directors - and the reporters who work for them .
56 % of managers at national level are certain that their reporters share their values , whilst at local level the percentage decreases to 23 % .
For some this has got to do with " job security . "
On a national level , 43 % of the managers believe they will lose their jobs within 3 years .
For journalists the figure is 30 % .
As for " job security " at staff level ( our editors , ndr ) in America it varies on a day to day basis .
Only 13 % of journalists have a work contract .
In an immense nation such as the USA , with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journals , magazines , radio , TV , and internet employers offer whatever they want and hence it becomes a question of take it or leave it .
Directors almost always receive huge salaries , while an editor may earn 10 thousand dollars a month , in addition to the pension and paid insurances .
As for holiday , things get complicated : so many days the first year , so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years .
But American journalists , by their own admission , fall frequently " ill " during the year .
It 's all a question of climate .
You don 't think - you pay !
Emotive campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history .
That 's also one way to characterize the emotive media campaign which the Ministry of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday .
The office of minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that it will discourage drivers from behaving dangerously behind the wheel .
The 150-million-crown campaign will appear on television , on the radio , in cinemas , on the Internet , but also on flyers .
It should discourage drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol .
And also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they start driving .
Above all , it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers , motorcyclists , pedestrians , and last but not least , professional drivers .
And what appears in the spots ?
Mainly human stories that attack the emotions .
And even the " bloody " slogan of the whole campaign attests to this :
You don 't think - you pay !
The words " you don 't think " are written in capital letters on a license plate .
And then the words " you pay " are in a pool of blood .
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his / her own life .
The spots will " haunt " the viewers until 2010 .
The ministry found inspiration in similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries , where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims .
It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decrease .
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG .
Sugar and whip for drivers
" The drivers are influenced by the sugar and whip system .
The sugar for them is , for example , when they run a red light , they save time .
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident .
The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk , " says Martin Kořán , a transportation psychologist from Na Homolce Hospital .
And that 's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary , the psychologist believes .
Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers ' attention to the danger .
" If a static table which warns against danger is installed , it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it , " Kořán warned .
Questions after accident : Are stewards in the bus illegal ?
Law doesn 't know them , walking in coach bus not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near Padua , Italy , the question has arisen as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion .
" If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law , the activities of the steward are in conflict with the Traffic Law , " says speaker for the Ministry of Transportation Karel Hanzelka .
The accident , during which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week , was evidently caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus .
Unluckily , at that moment , the girl was sitting next to the driver , in the least safe place in the vehicle , even though there are two more seats reserved for her .
However , the bus can crash or brake sharply even when the steward is handing out coffee or newspapers .
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role .
If this is not approved in the bus , the passengers must sit .
The Student Agency coach buses do not have standing room ; which the head of the company , Radim Jančura , also confirmed for Aktuálně.cz.
" We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry , and initially they did not permit the movement of the passengers .
Eventually they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat , " he conveyed his position .
The law does not know the steward
" There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the steward - no legal enactments deal with this role .
However , nor do any legal enactments prohibit the transporters from providing services .
The Traffic Law only knows the term vehicle conductor ; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person , " speaker Hanzelka added less unambiguously .
The head of the Department of Motor Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transportation , Josef Pokorný , on the contrary , said that the law treats this issue sufficiently .
" It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certification .
That 's all there is to it , " he says .
Buses are divided into the categories of city bus , where there is standing room and limited maximum speed , inter-city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted , and coach buses , with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts .
Like in an airplane , says expert
Jaroslav Hořín , an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traffic Safety ( BESIP ) , does not see any essential problem in the movement of stewards on the buses .
" During a smooth ride , there is not much threat of danger , the situation can be compared to the service in airplanes .
Even there it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can hit her head . "
" However , if the bus were to brake sharply , of course , the laws of physics are valid .
Just like in a city bus or a tram .
The transport provider must deal with the safety of the stewards through internal regulations , " he says , and he also thinks that from the legal perspective , this issue is unresolved .
Jančura willing to discontinue services
Student Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the steward service .
It employs nearly two hundred of them .
Even after the accident , the head does not consider their job to be risky .
" But as soon as I gain the impression that the stewards ' job is risky , I will discontinue them .
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding .
It would also save costs , " he says .
Alexej Litvin , head of Asiana , which operates a fraction of the bus lines that SA does , explained the absence of stewards in his vehicles as due to safety interests .
" We don 't have stewardesses , we 've been against it from the very beginning .
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident , " he told Týden.cz nearly a year ago .
Enormous tragedy occurred
A young stewardess from the Pilsen area , who had worked for the company for two years , died in an accident on the bus line to Naples .
A Slovenian tractor trailer truck likely left the emergency lane without signalling and blocked the path of the bus .
The bus driver tried to avoid it using a sharp manoeuvre , however , the front right part of the bus grazed it .
Jančura rebuffs the claim that the two seats reserved for the stewards ' rest had been sold out .
" It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses , they are blocked . "
The company plans to sue the driver of the truck .
The agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl 's family , but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party .
Adaptation of the law ?
Far away
An adaptation of the law , on which a thirty-member expert group from the Ministry of Transportation has been working for over a year , could bring about the specification of the movement of stewards on board the buses .
" But no concrete conclusion has been reached .
They are not dealing with buses much , it is more the point system , the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving , " says expert Hořín .
" The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way , " concludes speaker Hanzelka , adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office .
The elite in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a couple of days back with the vote in the Chamber of Representatives against the rescue plan of 700 billion American dollars passed by the White House : a significant portion of Americans was , and still is , more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy .
A confirmation was given by yesterday 's New York Times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the Republican Party , ever more divided between its old East Coast soul , moderate , in favour of federal institutions and the business community , and its new soul , instead conservative , hostile to " those in Washington " and to the financial world , especially strong within the Central and Southern states .
The soul , to be exact , which has made itself overbearingly alive with the vote mentioned initially .
The latter is but only one example of the changes , of the big changes , that the current economic earthquake perhaps heralds or allows to be perceived : not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here .
Both in the USA as in Europe the crisis seems to act as a catalyst for phenomena which have been in incubation for some time and which in the new climate have solidified and are finally coming to light .
The first of these phenomena is the bringing back up-to-date , the extraordinary re-launch , of the twin category state-sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-nationalisation of the economy .
The crisis , in fact , is a crisis for the financial-banking institutions who have , indeed , strong ties with foreign countries , but which above all deal with the budgets of persons or families who live in a single nation , in a single state .
This immediately creates a political problem for whoever is in government : and that is how to respond to the difficulties and the protests of those people and those families that , besides , also form the electorate .
In other words the crisis appears to be economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively a national problem .
Political internationalism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say : the clear proof of this is given by the European Union that , divided as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies , cannot decide on a common political path .
And so it is from the government of each single State that all wait for intervention , bailout and re-launching plans , new rules , and especially financial aid : since that when it comes to worst it is only the States that have financial resources , the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things .
And they possess likewise the necessary means , and the legitimate reasons to use them : two resources of incommensurable value , under certain circumstances , of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dispose of in an analogous measure .
This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the statal-national element is after all perfectly tuned with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attribute to a coefficient that is very closely connected to that element : territoriality .
Paradoxically , in fact , while we were convinced that we had entered the reign of the web , of a technology increasingly more sophisticated , of the immaterial , while we were convinced that globalised finance was by now destined to dominate the world , we became suddenly aware that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little immaterial such as water , harvests , oil .
Accidentally , all are items that can certainly be transported from one place to another but in any case are tied in an absolute fashion to a well defined space , to a territory .
So that whoever finds himself to be the sovereign , surely holds more cards in his deck than he who isn 't , than he who happens to live in a place without crops , oil , or water .
I 'm getting to the second novelty that however predicts a split .
Whoever says Territory , State , Government , inevitably implies Politics , and hence Leadership .
In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena .
On the one hand the knowledge of the objective need for authoritative leadership , the demand for somebody who knows how to handle the situation .
On the other hand a wave of discredit for existent leadership , an economic sort , revealed to be so inadequate and full of grey areas .
And together something ever deeper and in a certain way disturbing : a discredit , an intolerance , an image of inadequacy , a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire ruling class of an ever-increasing number of Western countries .
Rather , it appears to make its way further in vast sections of the population the conviction which before that their actions are the same ideas as of the social elite up till now in favour , their way of feeling and being , their culture in all accepted meanings of the word , to have had their day , and to always be more alien to the opinion of the majority .
In other words , the call for leadership feeds underhandedly a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the managerial class and of the traditional political structures , that manifest itself in the sudden electoral " revolts " or abrupt twists in the collective moods in these last and latest times , from the conservative rise in Austria - Bavaria to the collapse of the labour consensus in Great Britain , to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush ( and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it ) .
One gets the impression that the traditional elite , their parties , their programmes , but also their rites , their newspapers , their accredited intellectuals , some would say their formats , are finding it always more difficult to comprehend , and hence to represent , that which has been taking shape within the deepest layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening , augmenting , potentially agitating without restraint .
In face of all this , talking about a " rebellion of the masses " as being the order of the day may be frankly exaggerated .
But keeping one 's eyes wide open , it is not for sure .
Microsoft looks for a ( virtual ) receptionist
During the conference on Emerging Technologies at the MIT , Microsoft presented a preview of the new recognition and human interaction system , a kind of artificial intelligence , but without that much intelligence , able to perform some basic tasks , such as call a taxi ( or , in the scenario described by Microsoft , a shuttle service to move within the company 's campus ) " understanding " what happens in a standard conversation .
Thanks to a camera and a forms and faces ' recognition system , this " receptionist " may know how many people are there in a specific room , who are they - including remember what 's their position - and listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them .
It may also clustered people in groups of conversation .
The demo showed that the receptionist notes a third person , understands he does not belong to the group he is talking with and that he is not a company 's employee .
It asks him if he 's there to visit someone and says it will attend him as soon as possible .
This without any awful blue screen .
Awesome .
But this is the future , of course .
Now the company needs to focus on many other issues , such as the next Windows operating system 's release .
This week it was a big talk on Microsoft 's change of strategy .
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not be charged with so many programs .
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rubbish , these should be five times faster - hey ! Steve , will be for less .
A real discovery , if one takes into account the fact that Microsoft , version after version has only added features and " extras " to Windows .
The change of direction is very welcome .
Microsoft is right : the operating system will be increasingly losing importance , and the software with it .
When Google launched Chrome , I was one of those who supported the theory this was the first step Google made to compete with Windows .
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system .
The operating system will be always a necessity because it is the essential element through which hardware and software can communicate .
It performs the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law .
It 's true .
It won 't ever disappear , perhaps you just need to think about the " death " of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one .
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea .
People give less attention to the operating system , and increasingly focus on the browser .
They only use the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - daily and spend a longer time browsing the web rather than working in a window environment .
What half of the operating system 's applications are there for ?
Less is more .
And Windows 7 should be less , much less than Vista .
Less heavy , less loaded , less complex .
A Microsoft more interested in integrating its online services should constitute a viable alternative to Google .
Actually , they desperately need it . Let 's take a little example .
I shot the photo of this post during the Microsoft employees ' break , in Redmond , earlier this month .
A sign , hanging on the soft drinks ' machine suggested them to use the company 's search engine - " Your search . Our Future . "
In 2006 , an independent study reached the conclusion that the 66 % of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the net .
Last week , moreover , Microsoft confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7 .
It will not be launched on the market at the beginning of 2009 , but even at the end , maybe in 2010 .
Microsoft surely will try a joint launch , Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together .
Our phones , at the very end , is increasingly becoming a computer .
But the delay , with Android and the iPhone already on marketing , will result detrimental .
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso used to dress it while in the French Riviera , Leonardo di Caprio shone with one of this in ' Diamante de sangre ' by Edward Zwick , as well as Al Pacino in ' The Godfather ' of Francis Ford Coppola . Moreover , it is part of the typical uniform worn by the muscular gay parish .
If we try to count the number of stars wearing it , we can also recall the image of the strong-built man with pointed mustache who lifted weights in the strolling circus .
Finally , this is nothing more than the typical T-shirt for men , with a cotton interior , tight and sleeveless shape .
It is the ' tank ' , as English speakers call it , though , the Brussels Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all .
First of all , this is due to its grandiose name - even if it is commonly known just as " Marcel " - name that has something to do with the sport because it derives , according to the legend , from the boxer Marcel Cerdan , who loved the singer Edith Piaf .
The " Marcel " excels - if compared to the others - for its high quality cotton , for its unisex cutting , for his distinctive little shield and the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable ) , which the most emblematic models keep as a detail on the neck .
And open your eyes ! , because the Belgian company does not produce only its famous " tank . "
The production also includes college sweats , vintage boxers , cashmere cardigans , cotton trousers , sailor shirts , baby-dolls , mini shorts ...
Garments meant to be comfortable .
It is a pity to use them as underwear .
They 're too smart .
Speaking while sleeping
Some children speak during the night .
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something happened to them the day before , but those children who talk while asleep .
The first time it happens , at most , you get scared , but it really does not have that much importance .
This is a benign alteration of sleep , defined somniloquy .
It is a quite common phenomenon , especially in children and adolescents .
Certainly , most of you have been told talked in your sleep .
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically ( just once in life , for example , associated with an episode of high fever ) or on a more regular basis ( every day , once a week , once in the month ... ) . The day after the child does not remember anything .
There is not a single reason to explain the presence of somniloquy .
Sometimes it should be linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares , night fears , nocturnal enuresis ( do pee in bed ) , or sleepwalking , but it is not necessarily the case .
As mentioned above , it may be associated with stages of very high fever , in situations of stress or over excitement .
In any case , this phenomenon is not researched that well .
Even its intensity is extremely variable .
It may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice , with loose words , almost in a whisper , or the opposite ( screams , cries , long speeches ... ) .
In case the event is particularly intense , the child should be observed and possibly , a specialist should be consulted to check if the abnormal state of anxiety is due to any question , thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings .
We said that this is a benign alteration , therefore there is not a specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders which , instead , can be treated ( for example , if coupled with insomnia or a situation of stress ) .
What you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very simple preventive measures , such as :
Try not to over-excite the child before going to sleep .
Propose calm games and avoid television programs or series that inspire fear or suggest violence .
Very nervous children for whom relaxing is a very hard task , need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm .
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully .
Once somniloquy appears , try to keep calm .
Remember that it is an inoffensive phenomenon for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of it .
Useful Tips
Don 't wake him up .
It is useless , because he is not aware of what is going on , and you just interrupt his sleeping .
Although he is talking , he is asleep and thus , he is resting .
Remember that if he appears very anguished and the episodes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to verify from where such a great anxiety comes from .
If you get what he is saying ( which is not the most common situation ) does not fall into temptation to make him an interrogation to obtain information .
Do not get anything , because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts .
In addition , you are only able to hear what he says but you cannot see what he is dreaming about to say that things . Therefore , be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead .
Do not ever tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his secrets .
Not even jokingly .
This can generate a huge anxiety .
In short , do not worry , it 's nothing serious , just an episode that lasts few minutes .
" I want to be a young mother , doesn 't matter the candidate "
The great resemblance with her sister has not prevented her from developing a strong personality .
Monica Cruz is a tiny woman , but still , full of vitality .
Currently , both the Cruz sisters have taken very seriously their new activity in the fashion field .
According to Monica , it is much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their names .
She went to Paris for the campaign Mango is hanging on to promote the new branch , and the presentation of the most important prizes for fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house .
Warm and timid , she conquers you quite quickly .
Tell us what you 're doing in Paris .
I came here to present the new collection my sister Penelope and I have designed for the new Mango autumn-winter season , to join the second edition of ' Mango Fashion Awards ' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino .
Let 's say , a very intense day but a very exciting one , at the same time .
What is the inspiration of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish fashion house ?
Both my sister that I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s . From there we get bigger inspirations .
Then , I like to get lost in the city and look at how women dress , at the way they combine and mix their clothes . I do it quite frequently .
Dancer , actress and designer , you 're a very versatile woman , aren 't you ?
I think so , although at the very end , all merged and many elements remain cross-field ideas .
I liked clothes since I was a child . I loved to visit my grandmother to rummage in my aunt 's cupboards and discover her clothes .
It was so good ! , much better than going to the amusement park .
Then , once a dancer , I always took great care of my dressing .
It is known dancers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance recitals , to look themselves in the mirror and feel good .
And in the actress role , when you are delivered the wardrobe , this is the time you actually encounter the character .
So , everything goes together , yes , with a lot of respect for designers and professionals .
Not long ago , you celebrated your 30 years , did you entered a crisis ?
Absolutely I didn 't .
I 've never felt better , I like to be 30 years old .
I find it is the age when women are mature enough and can take advantage of a good experience to enjoy life and commit fewer errors .
I 'm not scared by the biological clock .
Since I was a child , I did all the things I liked to do and this gave me a great inner happiness .
So , are you thinking of being mother or not ?
Yes , of course , I 'm . I know it is my same body pushing me for this and also I want to be a young mom , I 'm not gonna miss it .
And about the candidate ... Does not matter that much .
I will give my son a lot of happiness and I will educate him with bigger love .
Talking about cinema , you are waiting the release of some films you acted last year .
That is , and I 'm really curious about that .
Coming from the theatrical experience , I am a very impatient and anxious woman , I want everything now and clearly , but I know this may not be always possible .
I 'm looking forward mainly for " La última hora " and " En busca de la tumba de Cristo . "
Let 's see if you like it ...
Few days ago you debuted on the catwalk side by side with Naomi Campbell , didn 't you ?
Well , don 't put it this way .
It 's not I was on the catwalk as a professional model .
Simply Naomi Campbell , whom I know since a long time , called and invited me to go to London and attend a charity fashion show for her organization " Women for a Better World . " The clothes presented during the show - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - have been sold at auction to raise funds for this Naomi 's NGO .
People usually ignore this Naomi 's tender heart .
It is said so many things on her , that , knowing her quite well , I can assure you are not true .
Moreover , I like to share and get involved in this good part of hers .
She asked me to be shown for a noble cause , but if I had asked to play a pine , I would do it anyway .
You cannot back out of helping the third world women .
No Sleep for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
As recently as last week , German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stressed that the banking system of Germany was relatively stable .
It 's a good thing that the politician used the term ' relatively , ' further interjecting that the German banking sector wouldn 't be spared by the crisis .
Because that 's what happened this weekend .
The real-estate bank Hypo Real Estate ( HRE ) from Munich , which is listed in the DAX stock index , is receiving credits in the billions from a consortium of German banks in order to be shielded against the market turbulences .
An individual close to the proceedings told Reuters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total .
Hypo Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using , they said .
The money was coming from private as well as public banks , they added .
The news comes in the wake of losses at subsidiary Depfa .
According to a news report , the government-funding bank had refinanced long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which , due to the mistrust at the markets , is no longer a possibility .
In the first half-year of 2008 , the bank 's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 Euros , with the capital resource quota also slightly declining from 1.6 to 1.45 percent .
The ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to nil compared to the same period in the previous year , while earnings from write-ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liquidation of accruals from credit transactions had shrunk by more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros .
The decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former Depfa Group , as well as from refunds of interest according to the Fiscal Code and from agency for group companies .
After going private in 1990 , the former government-funding bank had initially incurred speculation losses through commercial real-esate credits , which were then outsourced to Aareal Bank .
Because earnings in classical government-funding were slim , Depfa had diversified internationally , increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of joint ventures between private investors and the government ( Public-Private Partnership , PPP ) .
Now Hypo Real Estate has to induce write-offs according to the subsidiary 's worth that will have a ' significant , material effect ' on the group 's profit-and-loss statement , it said rather vaguely .
As a matter of fact , the dividend has been omitted .
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007 .
Since the acquisition of Depfa , Hypo Real Estate has been a significant financer of government and infrastructure .
Because it does not have client deposits , it is more dependent on refinancing at the interbank market than other banks .
With the collapse two weeks ago of American investment bank Lehman Brothers , the extension of loans among banks has largely dried up again , because banks are hoarding their assets .
For part of Depfa 's loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion Euros - Hypo Real Estate annually requires short-term capital for refinancing .
According to Hypo Real Estate , the credits meet the group 's financing requirements for the foreseeable future , shielding the corporation from ' the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international financial markets . '
Other sources say that , thanks to the credits , refinancing is covered until late 2009 .
HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke said that , in the foreseeable future , the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again , however .
The Deutsche Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision ( BaFin ) are now considering the Hypo Real Estate Group 's marketability to be secured .
On behalf of the bank 's shareholders and creditors , it is to be hoped they are right .
But given the dynamics and the unpredictability of the crisis , things are likely to remain uncertain .
It 's not even unthinkable that not all of the financing will be needed .
The opposite cannot be discounted either , however .
After the bank was reportedly close to insolvent late Sunday night , even a bailout , temporary as it is , is incapable of easing people 's minds .
The price per share is dropping by 75 percent to 3.30 Euros .
Bond prices are holding up reasonably well , meanwhile .
Whereas senior debts are hardly moving , junior bonds are dropping more significantly .
This mainly applies to bonds of former subsidiary Wuerttemberg Hypo and , understandably , to repayment periods beyond 2009 .
To date , Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for speculative investment . After the financial crisis , as well as the bank 's own homemade crisis caused by the acquisition of Depfa , however , their recoverability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system .
As long as central banks , governments and less stricken corporate banks are still willing to support the system , bond settlement deadlines can be met .
Alternatively , that which nobody dares to hope for yet right now comes to pass , and the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months .
But considering that one report of partial nationalization is chasing the next , a probability bordering on certainty has now shrunk to a valid hope .
This may be causing some sleepless nights for long-term creditors in particular , as they ponder the question whether or not to abandon their exposure .
Short-term investors may at least use the line that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss carry-forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come .
Second Weekend at the ' Wiesn ' Is Known as ' Italian Weekend '
For Elena it 's the first time , for Luca it 's the third or fourth already .
But this time , he brought along his girlfriend Elena , and that changes everything , he says .
Behind them , next to a five-litre keg of Kaiser beer , stands a massively built bearded man who is proving to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest tourists just how deep the sounds are that his throat his capable of producing .
Elena first slaps Luca , then kisses him .
They came to Verona from Bologna .
From here , a parking lot for buses next to the railroad station Puorta Nuova , four buses will depart at 11 : 45 tonight , ' destinazione Monaco , festa della birra . ' Estimated time of arrival : 6 : 30 AM .
Three buses are reserved for Italians mainly , one is exclusively for Brazilians .
In one corner of the parking lot , the South Americans are already singing next to their flag . They were celebrating last night already .
And very loudly , too , says Marco Guarda - too loudly for Italians .
Marco , who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and glasses with broad silver earpieces , owns the buses .
They have been making trips to the Oktoberfest for five years now , three of them this year alone .
They travel at night , spend the day at the ' Wiesn ' and head back home again at 10 : 30 PM .
Staying over night would only generate unnecessary costs , Marco says .
The trip is 75 Euros , including a welcoming round of Kaiser beer , brewed according to the Bavarian Purity Law , health insurance , as well as a German-language guide - Marco enrolled in a language course in Frankfurt .
And with no further ado , the buses head out into the night , on the autostrada leading to ' Brennero . '
There is no beer to be had yet .
Soon all is quiet in the bus , the travelers are asleep .
As they should be - they are going to need their strength .
They stop in Brixen and in Holzkirchen , where droves of other buses with Italian plates are making a final stop on the Autobahn 8 , right before Munich .
When Marco 's group finally arrives , as planned , at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near Theresienwiese , about 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there .
Elena , Luca and the others gather . Marco addresses them one last time to give them their marching orders .
First up : Put on the yellow caps .
On the left side , they say ' Oktoberfest ' in Gothic type , next to the Internet address of Marco 's travel agency , " conoscersiviaggiando.it. "
Second : ' When the doors of the beer tent open , you have to run ! ' Marco shouts into the morning .
' Run ! ' Run and man the seats in the rear part of the tent .
' Not in the front , or else we will block the entry . And not all yellow hats at the same tables - spread out in the room ! '
It 's 8.25 Euros per ' Maß , ' Marco screams .
And don 't forget to tip .
' Show the security people that we behave !
As soon as you abandon your seats , they 're gone ! '
Third : ' Be back here tonight at 10 : 30 sharp ! ' Understood ?
And off to the ' Wiesn ' they go .
One of them is marking the way by tying yellow caps to trees , signs and even to campaign posters of a political party that 's popular in Bavaria .
They want to be prepared for the retreat .
It is the second weekend at the ' Wiesn , ' known as the ' Italian Weekend . '
There are no exact figures ; estimates say that around 50,000 make their way across the Alps to descent on the beer tents - ten percent of all visitors on this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy specifically for this purpose .
Munich 's police are reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol , and Italian volunteers are lending support to the Bavarian Red Cross , according to whose statistics on nationals the Italians are leading the medical-attention field with about 200 cases , with Austrians ( about 80 cases ) and Britons ( about 60 cases ) coming in second and third .
Italians are especially fond of the ' Hofbräu ' tent .
Duesseldorf Hopes Rest in Frankfurt
In a letter from the WestLB board of directors to the bank 's employees , grand talk is not in short supply .
Combining units of the Duesseldorf institution with Frankfurt 's Deka Bank , the notice made public on Monday claims , could ' create a major capital-market institution of the Sparkassen Finanzgruppe . '
WestLB would contribute to the deal a ' bloc of expertise ' with sustained earning power , it says .
Generally , the letter suggests , this kind of jointer might provide the pivotal impulse for further concentration in the area of the German state banks , the Landesbanken .
That 's what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate being on top of things in difficult times .
The flagging WestLB is still exposed to tremendous pressure , after all .
Not just from the EU Commission , but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision , which only recently warned the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there was an urgent need for a solution .
But talks of some type of jointer between Deka Bank , which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment funds , and WestLB have been making the rounds for some time now - even in Frankfurt .
Presenting the report on the first two quarters in late August , Deka Bank head Franz Waas said a fusion between the institute on Mainzer Landstrasse and a Landesbank , such as Hesse and Thuringia 's Helaba or WestLB , made little sense to him .
But the administrative board of Deka , which is owned in equal parts by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations , has asked the board of directors to commence talks with WestLB on joint business ventures .
The possible subject is the capital-market business , or parts of it .
Of course , as sources in the financial community point out , negotiations have only just begun .
It 's not the first time that the name Deka Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolidation .
In 2003 , a merger of Deka Bank with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba briefly seemed to be within the realm of possibility .
But in the end , the threesome didn 't happen .
As soon as the plans became public , the Hessian state government spoke out against the participation of Helaba .
The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement .
Instead , Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was bought by Stuttgart 's Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg .
But deliberations on a jointer between Deka Bank and Landesbanken have continued to rear their heads .
Most recently , Guenther Merl , chairman of the board at Helaba , had quelled considerations of a merger with his institution .
This aside , there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative .
First up , now that the state elections in Bavaria are over , a jointer between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg may have become more likely .
For Helaba , that 's not necessarily good news .
Should the pressure for more mergers increase , it will by degrees be running out of potential partners .
In the South , it would merely be a junior partner , although it has to date weathered the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and Stuttgart .
A merger with WestLB , in turn , was squashed early this year by the Savings Bank Association of Hesse and Thuringia , which owns 85 percent of Helaba .
Remains only NordLB .
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the equation .
On the other stands the question in how far the institutions ' different business models are compatible with another .
In June , Merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustainability of the Landesbanken had not yet been resolved by the German Savings Bank Association .
Ultimately , WestLB might also be split up , although , of course , that 's not a solution favored at WestLB .
The letter from its board of directors , accordingly , voices the manifest desire for a ' comprehensive solution . '
Quite how this is reconcilable with a jointer between individual units of WestLB and Deka Bank remains to be seen .
What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag and his companions ?
The conduct of the criminal prosecution of János Zuschlag and his companions will be started on 8th October .
The politician and his companions have been accused of taking part continuously and on a professional basis in a fraud causing significant damages , as well as in other criminal activities , including forgery .
According to the prosecution , they used the awarded tender funds for their own purposes and often certified the performance of tasks by fake invoices .
The state and municipal funds - HUF 65 million in total - have been shared between the organization Fiatal Baloldal and other people .
The methodology - which has been published by the investigating authority , too - was to use bills of costs with unreal performance in order to access the awarded tender funds . This way the associations never met the agreed undertakings .
Most of the invoices were false according to the indictment .
The invoice templates were acquired in the Józsefváros market and the round stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas .
The selection of the companies in the name of which the bills were issued was completed on a trip in western Hungary , where János Zuschlag sent István Lados .
According to the testimony of the latter one , he was ordered to select pensions and restaurants .
He asked for the bill of his consumption at the specific place , and based on this invoice they prepared the invoices to be submitted to the tenders called for by institutes such as the Ministry of Youth and Sports , the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest .
These were submitted mainly by István Lados and his companion , András Őri , who was responsible for writing the reports required to qualify for the support .
One of Lados 's " study visits " was to a beer-house .
According to the invoice dated 2003 and issued by Zuschlag and his companions , the establishment provided food for a group of 90 people , who were members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület .
However , as the director of the company states , the establishment does not even have the capacity to provide seats for such a great number of people .
The invoice submitted in the summer of 2002 to the foundation called Jobb Jövőért - which was later renamed to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért - also contained several mistakes in its form and content .
The bill was issued for the accommodation of 130 guests in a 3-room pension in Badacsonytomaj , which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people .
The imaginative fillers of the invoices went also too far when they indicated Pigal Kft. in the documents . It is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accusation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá .
Győző Farkas , director of the firm said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned and the invoices were shown to him , he recognised their false nature immediately .
" The name and tax number of our company were placed incorrectly on the stamp . "
And he added that , moreover , the invoice had been issued for the accommodation of 100 persons in spite of the fact that they had only 11 rooms , which did not have the capacity for so many people .
In addition , the bill included catering as well , though their restaurant had not been in function for long .
The enthusiastic bill-makers were not aware of the fact that the Budapest-based travel agency that they selected organizes foreign tours only , thus the indicated Hungarian transport - as a service category - did not coincide with the invoice issuing practice of the firm .
Furthermore , - as it has been discovered during the investigation - they also indicated VAT on the document in spite of the fact that the transport activities to foreign countries other than the European Union were exempt from VAT .
The degree of VAT , which has been shown in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the foundation Jobb Jövőért , was also incorrect since the service of the firm should have been increased by VAT of 15 % , instead of the indicated 25 % . Additionally , the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machine-made invoices , while the reviewed bills were manually prepared .
The invoice-issuers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosecution procedure . This activity was not included in the services carried out by the firm originally dealing with investment consulting .
The fake nature of the bills issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány , XXI . Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont was disclosed due to formal deviations such as inappropriate billing format and forged stamp .
Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sportcamp of Kunfehértó , the representatives of which denied having issued the bills .
The forgers did not even pay attention to the fact that the Nyíregyháza based HIB Kft. was under liquidation at the time ( 2001 ) when a group from Fiatal Városért Egyesület allegedly had lunch there . The insolvency practitioner denied having issued the document .
Issued consciously
The other group of the invoice-issuers consists of those having been aware of issuing fictitious invoices .
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued an invoice of about four million forints for on the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták . This invoice was issued to the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért .
According to the indictment , the director of Collab Kft. was encouraged by one of the defendants , Ludovic Györfi , to prepare a fictitious invoice .
Biogate Kft . - which is currently under liquidation - also cooperated with Zuschlag and his companions . In 2003 the company provided the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány , the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with invoices of roughly HUF 5 million with no real economic activity behind .
There was no cash flow either since the issued invoices were voided later , but the organizations forgot to indicate this in their documents .
The next category of the firms having issued the invoices are those being linked to the defendants .
A good example for this is Iván Kubatov , the delivery representative of the Ukrainian executive director of Delta Trió Kft. having its headquarters in Budapest , but not to be found there , which deals with fuel and vehicle trade .
In October , November and December the company issued several invoices for selling computing devices , in a value of approximately HUF 18 million .
According to the data of the investigation , these bills were purchased by the Kiskunhalas-based Cash Investment Kft . , which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005 .
The executive director of the above-mentioned company was a Romanian man , to whom Iván Kubatov was supposed to forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005 .
According to our information , Kubatov admitted having issued bills to Atlasz , Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and received the amounts paid .
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons , specifically at the request of Iván Kubatov .
However , neither of these firms operated actually , which the defendant explained by lack of orders .
Still , he could take advantage of these undertakings ; for his request , attorney Zsolt Szente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invoices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with Zuschlag , namely for Atlasz and Y-Generáció .
Kubatov provided 15 invoices for the organizations in the name of Cash Investment , Delta Trió , Fa-Bani Jos , Jos Investment and Linaxtrade , with a total value of HUF 14.2 million .
According to the prosecution , 10 % of the amount indicated on the invoices and the amount of VAT was the share of Kubatov .
He even had Szi-Beri Bt. issue fictitious invoices which were used for the tender of Biztos Pont .
In January 2006 Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a tender to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ( TMA ) , which is a non-profit organization of the socialist party .
They were awarded HUF 500.000 each , but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender .
In order to avoid the fraud being disclosed , they submitted the 5 fictitious invoices issued by Works Team Kft. to TMA .
These invoices were found - during the searches - in Árpád Kemecsei 's office located in the Ministry of Education .
Some defendants are likely to confess about the process of the invoice production - as they did at the attorney 's department , too .
The most interesting part of the situation could be János Zuschlag 's decision on disclosing his secrets .
His testimony so far is not very detailed , and though he did promise to provide information on all areas of the case , he has not done so .
The question is whether he is interested in fulfilling his promise or - in return for the reimbursement of most of the damage ( 50 million forints ) , the socialists have struck a deal with him and Zusi would rather take the rap .
Or he might just have taken offence since his requests regarding the alleviation of the conditions of his detention - in other words his being placed under house arrest - kept falling upon deaf ears .
While those who have committed the much more damaging and non-compensated economic criminal activities can walk freely in the streets or wait at their home for the end of the legal procedure being conducted against them , he does not have the opportunity to do that .
The psychology of overbidding : what do we spend more money on ?
At an auction , the customers tend to spend more money on a product and overvalue it .
The neurologist and economist researchers of New York University managed to disclose the neurological-economic basis of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behaviour .
According to their study published in the periodical called Science , people don not want to lose in a competition like the auction of eBay , thus they rather pay an unrealistically high price .
The research aimed at mapping the neurological scheme of this " game " with the help of experimental auctions .
A group of volunteers was playing lottery and another group was taking part in an auction . In the meanwhile , the active brain area of the experimental persons was being examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which overbidding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called striatum , situated under the cerebral cortex , was coming into operation upon the person 's defeat .
This area of the brain - besides its other functions - plays role in the " self-rewarding " mechanism of the nervous system .
Thus , according to the researchers , raising the price can be explained by the avoidance of the violent reaction of the striatum .
In order to justify their theory , the economist members of the research group conducted financial researches as well .
In this research three groups were making bids against someone , under various conditions .
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the certain product and they made their bids .
Another group got a promise of receiving an extra amount of 15 dollars in case of their victory .
The third group was provided by 15 dollars before the auction but in case of defeat , they would lose this amount .
As it seems , the only difference between the two groups was the emphasis of victory or defeat .
Proving the hypothesis of the neurologists , the members of the group " playing for not losing money " were ready to make higher bids than the control group or the group " playing for gaining money . "
" These results cannot be deduced from any existing economic theory .
The earlier theories explained the phenomenon experienced at auctions by the delight of victory and risk avoidance .
It was the neurological imaging methods that helped us to dissolve the contradiction between the two theories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end , " said Andrew Schotter , professor of the economic faculty of New York University .
Does it hurt less if you believe in God ?
According to a recent research , religious belief can be used as a kind of pain killer , which could have eased the death of catholic martyrs as well .
" The scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of believing in God on the degree of people 's sensitivity to pain , " says the British Telegraph .
Within the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 catholic believers and 12 atheists were given electric shock . In the meanwhile , all of them were studying a painting of Virgin Mary .
The results showed that the practising Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain .
Due to the brain scanning technology , it turned out that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation .
This was the first experiment in a series of research , which besides academicians includes scientists , philosophers , theologians from different departments of the university .
To be exact , a sparking object providing electric shock was attached to the left hand of the volunteers in the experiment .
The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings ; Sassoferrato 's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci 's Lady with an Ermine from the 15th century .
The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the believers would enter a sort of religious state of mind . Da Vinci 's painting was selected because of its similar style and calming nature .
The volunteers spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and received 20 electric shocks within four consecutive time periods , while they were looking at one of the above-mentioned paintings .
The Catholics described the situation as " safe " and " protecting " which made them " relaxed and peaceful . "
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - comparing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of Leonardo 's work .
According to psychologist Miguel Farias , taking part in the experiment himself , similar effect could be produced by any kind of painting having strong emotional influence on the certain person , even among atheists . It is all about finding the right picture .
" We should find a photo of someone who they feel very positive about , like a mother or a father , " says the psychologist .
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings of the research .
" Practising faith should change and often does change our personality , " he added .
After these great results the question now is how Leonardo 's or another highly appreciated painter 's picture of Madonna would influence the believers ' pain regulation ?
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results ?
You are what you share
On its 10th birthday Google can admit : it is there in the people 's pocket , as well as above their head , in the sky . Google knows where people go on vacation , what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are interested in .
In spite of all that , Eric Schmidt , a key person of the company is still not satisfied .
On the other hand , the sceptics who bring it in parallel with Orwell 's dreadful fantasy just cannot see the essence of web 2.0 .
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google was to collect further personal information about the users . It is necessary to maintain the Google founders ' original aim , namely : " to create a system for all the information of the world , " he added .
According to the Google-chief , the company - after having subverted the entire world in the last 10 years - is still at the beginning of the road towards the ability of treating all the information .
Answering the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like " What shall I do tomorrow ? " , or " What type of jobs suit me best ? . " However , software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient .
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that the terms searched by them are recorded , as well as the IP address used for the search and the pages visited by them afterwards .
Using the 2-year-old Personalized Search function , users can store their own surfing histories , they can review what they were looking for , what kind of links they clicked on before . In the long term , it can provide the users with personalized findings . The function called Recommendations will be based on the same logic : it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier .
" What happens if my personal data are used against me , if it is discovered what I do ? , " ask some of the users worrying about the information-monopoly of Google .
It is usually the degree of the potential power represented by the company that generates counter reaction in the users , not sense of guilt , fear of punishment , desire for freedom or rebellion against authority .
Nevertheless , it has been confirmed that all the searched terms are recorded and - where appropriate - those can even be transferred to third parties . In such cases nothing protects the privacy of the Internet users .
The best example for that is the concerted action against some Brazilian paedophiles ; Google transferred the Brazilian government some information from one of its social networking pages , called Orkut . The data supplied helped the government identify several paedophiles .
The users who were worrying about the invasion of personal privacy could relief back in May when Google - in association with the EEF electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right against the FBI : the court confirmed that under no point of the Constitution can the FBI oblige Google to provide any kind of , secretly asked information .
( Nevertheless , - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government did manage to get access to 50 000 web addresses and 1 000 search terms . However , it could not acquire the individual users ' search lists , nor a complete list of web pages and keywords covering a two-month period . )
As it seems , there are controversial opinions on Google . It is attacked by those who fear of giving out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life would be diminished by using the services provided by Google . Thus , they rather represent the resisting group of conservative multinational companies .
Meanwhile , the American geek culture and its wild oat including enthusiastic computer fans , activists , users in several countries consider them as the next generation of large companies , a " cool corporation , " in contrast to their opinion about their rival , Microsoft , the creator of Windows and the conqueror of the world , in spite of the fact that the two companies fight for the same goal .
One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications . Furthermore , the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - comparing to the official software giant 's practice - looks more available , youthful and cool .
Or maybe it is because of the fact that geeks can precisely see the problematic relation between personal privilege and Internet , which is in accordance with the most frequently discussed key expression of the last few years , web 2.0 .
Web 2.0 is about a collaboration to intentionally leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels . Though the degree of this act can be various , depending on the user , the main point is the same : we show ourselves to the world .
An average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or Xanga , they can even link them to other services like Twitter or the music list maker last.fm , then those can be connected to a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition , users can create blogs that automatically update the recently uploaded photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa .
We can read about several stories like this : the girl - checking the plenty of photos uploaded in the morning by common friends - finds out where her untrustworthy boyfriend spent his previous night . Or another one : an employee might lose his job just because he shared his opinion on the management in his blog . One consequence can be definitely drawn : the definition of privacy has been revalued .
If someone lives an online life , they are what they show of themselves - this is the basic concept behind the behaviour of today 's youth .
If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply just wants to bypass Google 's monopoly , it is also possible ( e.g. using Scroogle , which also applies the Google search system but purposely leaves no trace behind ) .
The number of those intentionally not registering to social networking sites is significant . This way they can avoid being discovered , Google 's online applications from text editor to image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever .
General public is looking forward to seeing what is still hidden by Google .
The company - with its value of USD 156 billion - is worth more than IBM ( USD 140 billion ) , Intel ( USD 124 billion ) or Coca-Cola ( USD 110 billion ) . In addition , the advertising spaces of AdWords / AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever-increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software developers a serious headache .
Nevertheless , critics can also find the disturbing counterpoints : the management completely rejected the employees ' objection , which burst out because the fee of the company 's kindergarten had been doubled . The daily canteen - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management . However , all these are nothing compared to the fact that Google bowed before the Chinese government in 2006 and - according to their agreement - the company has filtered all search results that offend good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime .
One of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be advertised in advance , only when they are ready to be used . Still , the coming months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world : some people predict that the book and magazine scanning and archiving project of Google will soon reach such proportions that it will have to face the Supreme Court . Others have fear of the Health system , which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us , including our previous medical findings , physicians and problems .
Finally , the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sci-fi writers of the next generation . Cory Doctorow 's popular novel , Scroogled applies Orwell 's style in the description of a future where a person can be pictured terrifyingly well only by using Google data .
Intelligent car imitates the flying of a bumblebee
What could be a better way to advance the development of crash prevention technology than to mimic nature 's obstacle detectors ?
Let 's examine bees , for instance !
In a surprising project that is in progress at CEATEC in Japan , the bumblebee has given engineers at Nissan a strategic hint at how to design the next generation of crash-avoidance systems .
Based on joint research with the University of Tokyo , Nissan has built the BR23C-type Biomimatic Car Robot Drive . It is a robotic micro-car that recreates bee characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents collisions altogether .
" In flight , each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space , which in fact closely resembles our safety shield , " said Kazuhhiro Doi brand director of technology , PR , research and development .
The compound structure of bees ' eye plays a significant role , which makes the bees able to see in all directions , at an angle of 300 degrees .
In order to recreate the function of a compound eye , the engineers came up with the idea of a laser range finder .
This device detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C , calculates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor , which is instantly translated into collision avoidance .
It takes just a fraction of a second to detect an obstacle , and the car robot instantly changes direction mimicking the movements of a bee by turning its wheels at the angle needed to avoid a collision .
One of the main differences from any current system is that the avoidance manoeuvre is totally instinctive .
" If that was not so , then the car robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles , " says Toshiyuki Andoh , manager of Nissan 's Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of the robot car project .
It must react instinctively and instantly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner-most layer of the safety shield , a layer in which a crash is currently considered unavoidable .
The whole process must mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees .
It must happen within the blink of an eye .
But unlike a bee , it cannot deviate upwards or downwards or diagonally , only in two dimensions and only in the direction that the wheels can turn .
So in place of the infinite number of ways a bumblebee can avoid other bees , here only the rotation function , the acceleration and the deceleration have been applied as available means of collision avoidance .
BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density , which - compared to the lithium-ion version - assures longer lifetime .
According to Andoh , what is important is the intelligent instinctive reaction , not the capability for data processing and storage .
The device is supposed to process only a few inputs per second and react on them accordingly .
There is no need for storing the inputs and reacting by the intuitive logic based on the previous manoeuvring data , so it allocates continuously only a few dozen kilobytes of memory .
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte size memory .
This is the first step of developing the instant collision avoidance technology that , on the basis of Nissan 's estimate , can be built into the series-produced cars within 10 years .
If connecting the device to the GPS satellite navigation system , an additional application option can be worked out which can help to avoid road barriers while driving .
First virtual operator to arrive in Czechia this year .
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe .
In spite of this , there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices .
It might be missing for a long time .
We have already written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe .
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bureau , who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union .
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees , a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home .
How is it possible that the prices in Czechia remain so high in comparison with Europe ?
The answer is simple , there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle .
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical , after all , we have three mobile networks here and over 100 % coverage .
Mobile operators , on the other hand , like to pretend that the Czech market is extremely competitive .
This is often seconded by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Bureau ( CTB ) Pavel Dvořák , who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for another operator in Czechia .
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance ( for that matter , it would be very difficult to find frequencies ) .
But there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator .
It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lowering of prices , to which even the classic operators had to react .
At the same time , even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile , voices similar to those here could be heard .
But it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful .
For that matter , we don 't have to go far to find examples .
In February of this year , we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland .
Over the course of merely half a year , this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator .
At the same time , the financial group Penta , which owns , among others , U : fon , stands behind Mobilking .
The advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group .
In order to function effectively , they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does .
That is , they do not carry the relatively high costs of construction , operation and maintenance of a mobile network .
In this way , virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer inexpensive calling and text messages , which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services , though .
That 's how , for example , Tesco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its competitors .
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows , it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group .
That is , this operator is specifically oriented toward men .
" Real men choose Mobilking - the operator that they like and can trust , " says David Seibert , the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company , which runs this virtual operator .
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here .
Miroslav Čepický , spokesman for Vodafone , doubts this : " The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual operators are founded .
In addition , it 's relatively saturated from the perspective of the offer of services . "
No chance in Czechia , say mobile operators
It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in Czechia , it won 't be Mobilking .
" We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project , but the negotiations in Czechia don 't look very hopeful .
More likely , Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region , " said Jana Studničková , speaker for the Penta financial group , in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Czechia are definitely not inclined toward this idea .
Rather , on the contrary , they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into existence .
For a longer period of time now , the GTS Novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator , and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the area of corporate clientele .
" We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services , but also mobile ones .
The sooner , the better .
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators .
We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them , " said the group 's spokesman , Pavel Kaidl .
Perhaps there are better times ahead .
On the basis of unofficial information , it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year .
In the meantime , however , its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence .
" At this time , we do not think that there is space for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator .
Compared to other markets , the Czech market is very specific .
No subject has approached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area , " claimed Vlastimil Sršeň from the public relations department of Telefonica 02 in a statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market .
In a rare shared opinion with a statement by O2 , T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová added : " We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous business project that it would be possible to build upon . "
And she added : " No virtual operator is likely to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year .
At this moment , in order to be talking about such a short timeframe , we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table . "
Vodafone is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license .
Regarding this , Miroslav Čepický said : " We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators , above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure .
From the perspective of the customers , we consider this to be the most beneficial .
Vodafone 's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Internet . "
Responsible authorities - buddy-buddy with operators
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand , the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition , it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits .
Why , then , make this entrance easy for such a competitor ?
The tug-of-war surrounding the creation of U : fon attests to the fact that when something is important to the operators , they are able to pull for the same team .
Probably the greatest pressure on the Czech Telecommunication Office was during the time of the creation of U : fon by T-Mobile .
Information publicly available from the Czech Telecommunication Office 's web pages attests to this .
But now this is a suitable argument for U : fon to not allow the entrance of the virtual operator .
Regarding that matter , Martina Kemrová pointed out : " The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently amplified by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market .
Considering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic , it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services . "
But considering this approach by the mobile operators , the lack of interest by the Czech regulatory organs is , in fact , startling .
This means not only the attitude of the CTO , which unfortunately in Czechia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition .
This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competition ( OPC ) exclusively .
But this office has assumed its typical position on this whole issue .
" The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator .
No such contract has ever been signed , because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators , " claimed Kristián Chalupa from the external relations department of the OPC in his answer to our question .
A statement formulated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won 't surprise anyone .
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and , among other things , make sure that no one abuses his / her position on the market , it is more than serious .
All the more so when Kristián Chalupa added : " In other countries , where virtual operators commonly function , we can observe that their entrance on the market contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services . "
But evidently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OPC .
In truth , the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile operators that is implicit in their reactions .
The question as to whether this is really just a coincidence arises entirely by itself .
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations is surely just the product of coincidence and the tough competitive battle .
" The Office did not find any signs of actions violating the rules of competition , and thus has no reason to intervene in any way .
None of the operators have a dominant position , and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market .
The telecommunications regulator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to open the mobile market for the virtual operators , " Chalupa claimed in his statement .
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the disputed points .
Of course , an analysis of the relevant markets does exist , conducted by CTO , according to which telecommunications are , from the perspective of competition , the only market .
On such a market , none of the Czech operators then have a dominant position .
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator , it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator .
And the mobile operator - entirely logically - has a monopoly on its network .
So in a certain segment , it must necessarily be dominant .
But even if we did not consider this argument , for the OPC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceeding in a strikingly similar manner .
At the same time , complaints from a series of interested parties ( including the GTS Novera company mentioned above ) demonstrate that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators .
Placing the responsibility on the CTO is a rather common trick in telecommunications , through which the OPC can have nothing to do with the whole matter .
We have already encountered it in several similar cases .
Unfortunately , it was not possible to establish the extension of the CTO 's authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telecommunications Act , even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation .
The representatives of the OPC must know this very well , but their interests are evidently elsewhere .
It can be done when nobody 's looking
At the same time , the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators , of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks , remains unnoticed .
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services , which are only partially public .
These are usually companies dealing with multilevel marketing .
For example , Amway , Bohemia Telecom , Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile telephone services .
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals .
The trick lies in the fact that , in relation to the operator , the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SIM cards .
As a significant client , it then gets special price offers ( and other types of offers ) .
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such advance sales .
" If the cases you are talking about were to occur , this could be a violation of the contract conditions , which we would investigate , and it could culminate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company , " Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem .
But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators .
This could be a question of thousands of customers , above all in the case of the three companies mentioned above .
But at the same time , none of the operators are opposed to such a procedure .
Namely , they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing .
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to potential problems : " The law enables such speculation , nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies .
On top of that , they must accept that the SIM card in their telephone is not registered under their name , and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can . "
This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the CTO .
In addition , another question for the OPC arises .
If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure , why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator ?
It must be added that the OPC has rather considerable power to uncover such activities , and if it does not wish to , it does not have to be satisfied with operators ' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it .
When we won 't be the most expensive
As mentioned already several times in this article , the entrance of the virtual operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services .
At the same time , classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created .
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small , too saturated , problems with the quality of services , etc .
But in developed countries , the regulatory organs , which supported the interests not of the mobile operators , but of their customers , intervened at that very moment .
Either through formal measures or informal pressure , they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator , and others continued in its footsteps .
Unfortunately , the Czech regulatory organs have been tossing the whole case back and forth like a hot potato .
Based on our experience , we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in competencies in these cases suits them very well .
But let 's not throw in the towel .
If the behind-the-scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon , the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again .
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator , it will be difficult for OPC to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal ( discrimination ) of further interested parties .
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe .
Razor 's edge battle : MP3 players vs. cell phones .
Our advice on how to choose
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files , no MP3 player can make phone calls .
This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a phone .
In spite of this , there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player .
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner .
It is not likely that you will get a top-of-the-line expensive record player in order to listen to the newest album by Maxim Turbulenc .
First of all such music products not available on LPs , but also , from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it .
However , if your shelves are crowded with art rock , jazz , or blues vinyl records , you are likely at least dreaming of a record player like that .
It 's the same with music on trips , that is , compressed music , simply put , MP3 music .
There are price and qualitative categories here as well .
For some , it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on an MP3 player , just as it is hard for Pink Floyd fan to accept twenty-crown headphones from a market hall .
Two extremes , between which there is enough space for everyone .
The selection is broad .
Battery life also decides
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than merely play music , but also what most cell phones can 't even do by chance .
No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone .
In addition to the primary functions , calling and texting , it can play music and video , record both , contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navigate in some cases .
And when we take smart phones and communication devices , you have a small computer in your pocket .
It 's a small miracle , as there is no refrigerator that knows how to grill and no television can take pictures .
The universal nature of the cell phone also brings disadvantages .
The more functions you use on your cell phone , the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger .
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers .
Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours , most of them much less .
In this way , music players ( particularly the simplest ones ) are much more efficient .
Which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours .
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that , to be on the safe side , get another charger for your workplace - even for more expensive devices .
You won 't have this problem with MP3 players , even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge .
Another problem arises when recording music on the cell phone .
Unfortunately , only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal USB connector , and on top of that , not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special software .
Of course , music can be recorded directly onto a memory card , but very few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adaptor .
For the music players , with some exceptions ( iPod ) , you don 't need any special software .
It 's enough to fill the device with music using the USB from the computer .
Most cell phones and music players already create a music library by themselves , organized according to the artist 's name , album title , genre , or , e.g. , user rating .
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory , similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both ( iriver , Samsung , Sony , Cowon , smart phones with an operating systems ) .
Music players easier to service , cell phones can do more
In choosing specific equipment , you should be interested above all in the life of the battery , the capacity of the memory , the quality and type of the audio output , and of course also the user-friendly nature of the operation .
If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while , perhaps in the tram , any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough .
Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do .
You don 't even have to pay too much attention to which music formats the cell phone or music player can handle .
The MP3 can handle all of them , and in fact , most of the music you will get will be in this very format .
It one of the most widespread formats and in addition to it , the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format .
Less common is the appearance of AAC ( the format used by the Apple company and its iPods ) .
Better cell phones , at the same time , enable the purchase of music on-line .
All you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator ( or another provider ) using mobile Internet .
This service by itself could be a substantial reason for obtaining a music cell phone .
Unfortunately the offerings from the operators are paltry and are usually limited to fast-growing radio hits .
The prices are also not among the lowest .
It is generally assumed , however , that this very manner of music sales ( whether using GSM , the Internet or wireless Internet ) will take over the music industry in the future .
Most people have their cell phone on them at all times .
Whenever you feel like listening to something , you can reach for your cell phone in your pocket , while the MP3 player lies at home , forgotten .
However , it still depends on whether you always have headphones or at least the wire hands-free with you .
If not , you can utilize the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones , but only in a minimum of MP3 players .
But the greatest advantage of the music cell phones for many people is the price .
The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand crowns .
For three or four thousand crowns , you can get a very decent walkman .
Usually , however , you 'll be limited by the absence of output on ordinary headphones .
The best and most technically well-equipped telephones , with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones , cost up to fifteen thousand crowns .
The advantage of the music players , on the other hand , is , among other reasons , that they are easy to operate .
Anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive ( see our selection ) - music players .
The minimum of functions and similarity in operation to the formerly common cassette recorder or even the record player is apparent .
There is no threat of a clash in the form of mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting enormous bill for data transmission .
What device to reach for
Even the least expensive cell phones ( e.g. Vodafone 527 ) generally have a slot for replaceable memory cards ( of the type M2 , microSD and the like ) .
Even with the additional purchase of the respective card , you will spend less than two thousand crowns .
Be careful , however .
With the basic models , only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported .
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards .
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player , reach for Cowon , Creativ , Sony , Samsung , Emgeton or iriver .
Based on capacity ( maximum 2 GB ) you don 't have to spend more than 1,100 crowns .
If you are a more demanding listener , reach instead for specialized cell phones - walkman ( Sony Ericsson , some Nokia and Samsung models ) .
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player .
Sony Ericsson , whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately , is the most advanced in the field .
The MP3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns , but with a greater memory capacity ( up to 16 GB ) and battery endurance ( normally 15 hours , maximally up to 35 hours ) .
Prague City Mass Transport to operate on chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday , October 1 , 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first travellers board the metro , trams and buses with an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket .
The roughly one hundred thousand people in possession of their own chip card Opencard at this time can get this coupon .
Travellers can buy a 30-day , 90-day and year-long coupon ( which will be valid beginning on January 1 , 2009 ) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum , Můstek , Nádraží Holešovice , Anděl , Roztyly , Letňany , Kobylisy , Rajská zahrada , Kačerov and Luka .
Beginning yesterday , coupons can also be purchased over the Internet on the web pages of the Transport Company , www.dpp.cz.
By the afternoon , more than four hundred customers had used the service .
Those beginning to use Internet shopping can definitively forget about the vending windows in the metro stations , where up to now they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets .
That is , they can buy the coupon over the Internet and it will be added to the Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the City Library .
" At these locations , there is a counter available for travellers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purchase , and will also add the purchased coupon to their card , " said the project 's speaker , Martin Opatrný .
In addition to libraries , it will also be possible to add the electronic coupons to the Opencard at the self-service machines which have been set up in several vestibules of the metro .
What do these self-service machines look like ?
They are red , resembling ticket validation machines , and travellers might have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly , Budějovická , I. P. Pavlova , Florenc and Vltavská .
" Now there are five of them in the city , but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them , " Opatrný added .
Coupon checked by self-service machine instead of driver
Using the self-service machines , which will begin functioning tomorrow , is simple .
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card , and the pre-paid card is automatically added to it .
The electronic coupons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city , but in its surroundings as well .
That is , in suburban trains and bus lines numbered 300 to 499 , which are mainly used by inhabitants of Central Bohemian towns to travel into the capital city .
" In trains included in Prague Integrated Transport , the conductors are equipped with card readers , with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the coupons , " Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid , which creates the timetables of the Prague Mass Transport , explained the ticket-checking procedures .
The suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver 's seat .
Upon boarding , it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver , but in addition it is necessary to place the Opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register .
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons recorded .
" If the traveller needs to confirm the validity of the coupons recorded , there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver , " Drápal added .
Travelers who do not use suburban buses , and will not remember when the validity of a coupon ends , can head again for the self-service machines where the coupons are added to the card .
Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the machine 's screen .
Congress yields : US government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and George W. Bush 's cabinet have agreed upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system .
The vote on it will take place at the beginning of next week .
American legislators made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars ( approximately 12 billion crowns ) .
But all is not won yet .
That is , the members of congress have to complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it .
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday .
The chair of the Financial Services Committee , Barney Frank , told Reuters this on Sunday .
Sources say that the senate could evidently vote on the plan on Wednesday at the soonest .
Economists say that the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor significant to the revival of financial markets .
Afterward , however , a " sobering up " will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in practice .
Paulson : Plan must be effective
" We 've made great progress .
We 've resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabilization of markets should look , " Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg .
According to her , the final vote could take place as early as Sunday .
Representatives of the legislators met with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson Saturday night in order to give the government fund a final form .
The fund is meant to purchase unsellable mortgage assets which are pulling financial companies down into heavy losses and are endangering the stability of the entire system .
" We 're on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be effective on the market .
It 's necessary to continue in the curative plan , but I think we 're there , " Paulson said .
A signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is significantly impacting the stock markets , which are dropping sharply .
According to Nevada Democratic senator Harry Reid , that is how that legislators are trying to have Congress to reach a definitive agreement as early as on Sunday .
Namely , by doing this they want to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets , which , given their time zones , are the first ones where the decision by Congress could influence Monday 's trading .
In the meantime , however , it is not yet clear with any certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the bill , nor whether the negotiations will not become hindered by some problem .
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days .
However , the bill will still go through a series of changes .
The total amount designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts .
The initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible , as requested by president George Bush .
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount , in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later , the final 350 billion dollars , if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function .
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
Though the president can veto this decision , Congress can override his veto .
Even in spite of these changes , the essential idea of the program , to gain finances for the buyout of bad mortgage stocks , the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay off their mortgages , has remained intact .
" We 've drawn it all up .
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday , " said Republican senator Judd Gregg .
Even American president Bush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations .
His speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush was satisfied with Saturday 's progress and appreciated the " two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and save our economy . "
Constraining golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , Christopher Dodd , the chief negotiator , said that the legislators had agreed upon the responsibilities for the financial program , protection of the taxpayers against losses , closing of relief packages , and timing of the financial plan .
The new law is also meant to constrain the " golden parachutes " for the heads of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee which will oversee the fund .
The committee is to be directed by the Ministry of Finance .
" We 've worked very hard on this and we 've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans , " Paulson said .
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems making their payments .
The cabinet should negotiate new payments for the mortgages it buys , with the aim of lowering the monthly payment costs for those in debt and enabling them to keep their houses .
Marek : Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance , David Marek , the proposed plan is a good idea , but its realization will be very difficult .
" And this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what price the problematic assets will be bought .
This will determine how the financial sector and the cabinet will divide the losses amongst themselves , " Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week .
Whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so significant , according to Marek .
" More important is for the members of congress to agree this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible .
The psychological significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time , " Marek emphasized .
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso , cities cancel historical theatres
Historical cinematographic theatres close in favour of Multiplex .
" A city without cinematographic theatres is a blind city , it 's like a face without eyes . "
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore efficaciously photographs what is happening not only in the large Italian urban centres but also in provincial towns .
The sidelining process of the cinemas , with the birth in the outskirts of large multi-hall theatres and the consequent death by consumption of the single-hall theatres within the central areas of the city , is one of those events that appears unavoidable and incontrovertible and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime .
Frequently , it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear , " it is as if a friend is lost , an acquaintance with whom we have shared the way and many memories , " observes the director of New Cinema Paradise , the film that twenty years ago gave Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes , and which narrated the poem of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema which , perhaps , has been lost forever .
The numbers provided by Anec , the main cinema-operators association , speak clearly : within the last five years 316 traditional style cinemas have closed shop , and the ones to pay the price were above all the theatres in the principal cities : 10 less in Florence , 9 in Milan , Naples , Bologna , and Rome , 6 less in Turin , 5 in Palermo .
Among the regions most badly hit by the closures , Emilia-Romagna takes the lead with 82 single-hall cinemas lost , followed by Tuscany ( 44 ) , and by Lombardy ( 41 ) .
And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multiplex is the most responsible for their disappearance , these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multiplex cinemas registered : 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years , 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna .
" The Italian business has developed in an irrational way " observes Paolo Protti , Anec 's president , " it 's useful that new structures are built but it 's also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed , because once a theatre in a city closes , not all its patrons may be inclined to transfer to the multiplexes .
Not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators : the previous debit by the state is of approximately 10 million Euro .
It 's disgraceful , from the ethical and from the moral point of view , that the government does not respect the existent laws .
To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are required . "
An interesting example is that of Bologna , the first Italian city that , concerned by the closures , has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec , the first of its kind in Italy , to protect and promote single-hall cinemas both in the historical centre as well as on the outskirts .
Among the foreseen provisions there are tax relief measures in favour of operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility : the spectators can enter in the traffic-limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks .
" It 's an initiative which I like " observes Giuseppe Tornatore " and hopes that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in action other measures .
It 's certain though , that to contrast the excessive power of the multiplex , traditional theatres have also to improve the sound and image quality , because the public nowadays is more demanding .
The defence of traditional cinemas is a theme that for me has always been important : the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema , the place of my infancy and adolescence , was the spark that convinced me to create " New Cinema Paradiso , " on which I have already been thinking for the last 10 years .
I have been living in Rome for 25 years , and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal in National Street both closed by now , there where I have experienced many shared emotions , I turn away so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust . "
When energy is born from the waves the big come into play
It 's an immense body , that occupies 70 % of the planet 's surface and now the big , international energy companies are discovering it .
Waves , currents , tides are the new renewable sources being eyed , and subjected to attempts of development , by colossi such as Chevron .
The possibility of extracting energy from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70 's , coinciding with the first oil crisis , research was intensified .
When the oil prices went down , around 1980 , the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside , but now the appeals by the environmentalists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector .
The World Energy Council ( WEC ) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world 's electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas ' undulating motion .
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations .
And then there would be the currents and the tides .
Colossi on the attack .
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis , which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of Portugal .
When the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary step .
Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these , there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy .
" Chevron is researching technologies for oceanic energy - a spokesperson for a company associated to the U.S. oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of collaborating with us . "
The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission , necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska .
This is a significant sign , especially if one considers that right in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set in motion a plan for new drilling .
Besides Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc . Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far , even though they are not known in detail , indicate according to the observers an increasing interest .
Technology to be made ready .
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy , marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its environmental impact .
Till now the plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to create big problems for the ecosystem .
To produce energy on a large scale , however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented .
And the choices are varied : Ocean Power , for example , uses a system of buoys connected between themselves .
The thrust of the waves , which makes the buoys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters .
The pressure turns a turbine which in its turn fuels a generator .
The electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables .
For now there are four plants of this kind being planned , waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used by a military installation .
Verdant Power , on the other hand , already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York 's East River .
The water movement when there are the sea tides makes the fans of the turbines go round , creating a rotary motion that powers a generator .
Verdant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to benefit from the energy .
After the waves , the tides .
Particular interest , declare the people at the Electrical Energy Research Institute , is deserved at the moment by the potential of tides .
Even though it is an intermittent phenomenon , the tide is more predictable than the wind , the sun , or the waves , and so is more reliable as a source of energy .
It 's exactly on tidal energy that states such as New York , Maine , and Alaska , together with others that overlook the coast , have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are foreseen investments of up to 35 million for 2009 .
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition , Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver , executive vice-president of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold .
Following an Orwellian logic , it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a " transparent public debate . "
While it is true that the judges are independent and impartial , especially in the cases of defamation , they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law .
Not surprisingly , this difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver .
Since , for Barrick Gold , the best way for it to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position ?
Regardless of the trial 's outcome , the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight , with very unequal resources , against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining .
The tactics , in these unequal struggles , is often to ruin the defendants with the aim of imposing a settlement that silences the opposition and in addition frightens anyone who dares to think of reopening the issue .
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate , it is before the public it should have presented its vision of the facts .
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold operates , the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not of baton thumps .
Thus , it would have been sufficient for the mining company to open its books , records and establish a real debate , through newspapers , the media , publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue .
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada .
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a " public " debate while at the same time disregarding the views of that very same audience ?
In the world of the Vice-President , it seems that this word refers only to high priced lawyers and not to all Canadians : that is a rather narrow view of the concept .
In a democracy , even the critics have the right to speak .
What Barrick Gold does not - or will not - understand is that the public which supports the writers and publishers of Black Canada , does so primarily because it rejects its brutal mining methods .
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge , but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments , and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution-gag ( continuing the " public debate , " Barrick Gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term ... ) .
Beyond the Mr. Garver 's surreal speech , the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth , essential for any democratic society .
It denies , collectively , the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpretations , which represents the very basis of intellectual work .
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects unpalatable to the wealthy corporations in the world in a country like Canada , under penalty of repeated prosecution , who can do it ?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate , it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada .
She has a right to reply .
The academia , to which we belong , has long been managing the debates and disagreements , and resolving conflicts .
Barrick Gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that , contrary to its claims , it did not want a transparent debate .
It is a loss for academia , as well as for public debate in Canada , and it is time that governments put in place devices that limit such frivolous practices .
Charest placed on the North
The prime minister does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year
Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished , Jean Charest yesterday visited Jean-Talon , Quebec City , where the new health minister , Yves Bolduc ( left ) is trying to get elected in the by-election today .
" Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier " : this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec , in Levis yesterday .
Behind him , during his speech , a kind of mill of images was projected .
Rotating in a loop on three huge screens , were dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams , mining developments , of Quebec seen through " Google Maps , " maps , etc .
Like the mass media during elections .
Moreover , as a point to emphasise , the Prime Minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this fall , although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy .
The " North Plan " is the fourth part of a " vision " that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec , that of a " new economic space , " which includes an agreement on labour with France , an agreement between Canada and Europe , and agreements with Ontario .
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently , the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation .
The Prime Minister had however to explain why the North was " a jewel with an immense potential , " but never given its due chance , investment money , or specific priority in future projects .
At most , a few avenues that could be further developed : including hydropower , the forest , but most of the entire mining sector , boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure .
The North contains " nickel , zinc , copper , platinum , gold , silver , iron , titanium , and even diamonds , " according to Mr. Charest 's list .
This territory is twice the size of France , " " it is here with us , it is in Quebec .
Not only is it with us , but it 's also us , " he insisted , to better show this he solicited a national founding myth .
The province has built much by its relationship with the North , he said : the gold rush in Abitibi , Quebec engineering , James 's Bay .
" We , our future , " he added after a theatrical pause contemplating the immense map behind him .
The North , 70 % of Quebec , includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed , " said the Prime Minister at the press briefing .
" This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated .
There is a border along which there has been no agreement for too long a time and , when the opportunity arises , I reiterate this position there on behalf of government , " he said .
Moreover , " with the climate changes , we must rethink our vision of the North , " he declared , referring to the Northwest Passage , to be held open throughout the year due to melting ice .
In this new geopolitical context , the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty .
And the inhabitants of the territory , First Nations and Inuit ?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would benefit them , especially to young people .
Two former ministers from two different parties , Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau ( former member Ungava PQ ) , have already started consultations with thirty communities .
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier , in which Julie Boulet ( Transport and Natural Resources ) has an important place , started work .
The Prime Minister has not excluded holding a big meeting , " not necessarily a summit , " but a time when " we give ourselves a common vision . "
Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development .
The North will be " coordinated , orderly and respectful of the environment , " he promised .
Jean Charest described this " vision " as continuous with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded him .
" As the Liberals who have preceded us , we have alternatively thought to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development . "
This has been one of the recurring themes of the weekend , which was launched Friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party .
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Adélard-Godbout .
" From Godbout , who created Hydro-Quebec , to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity , to Bourassa who made James Bay , our party has managed to forge the future , " declared Jean Charest .
In the press briefing , he invoked another reference , conservative as this , the program " Roads to the North " by John Diefenbaker , prime minister from 1957 to 1963 .
Addressing the proposed hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper , Mr. Charest has stressed that it should become operational for 2012 .
" Between us , but I plan to be there , " he told activists , eliciting from them a huge round of applause .
Indeed , the Prime Minister , who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009 , has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall , it is what the law permits him .
He stressed that his schedule is filled up , notably by a mission to the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit .
The weekend 's General Council provided the Liberal leader a platform containing the nationalists resolutions , notably some " constitutional aspirations " which passed through like a breeze : the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec in the Constitution .
It also wants Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec .
On the opposition side , the outline of the Northern Plan was received with scepticism .
The PQ leader , Pauline Marois , has brought up again the policy development of Northern Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001 .
According to her , the Liberal government , when it came into power in 2003 , had waived the application .
Had it done so , " it would be more advanced today , " commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon ( ballot which takes place today ) , Françoise Mercure .
The ADQ has supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government .
" But what is desired , is that it is not just for show , " said the leader Sébastien Proulx , replacing Mario Dumont , who returned from vacation today .
Operation Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress , both the Republicans and the Democrats , finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s .
The new version of the 700 billion U.S. dollars plan to curb the financial crisis that rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress .
In particular , it foresees : a better control by elected officials of its implementation , new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed , new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non-payment , as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued .
U.S. Treasury Secretary , Henry Paulson , the chairman of the House of Representatives , Nancy Pelosi , and Republican representative to the negotiating table , Senator Judd Gregg , announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday , following a marathon two-day negotiations .
" We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market , " declared the representative of the Bush administration , Henry Paulson .
" Everything has been done in order to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street , " said the Democrat .
" This is the fundamental point : if we do not do this , the trauma , chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense , " declared Republican Judd Gregg .
The negotiations turned into a sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors .
The deadline we had given was the opening of the markets this morning .
Associated late to the negotiations , the two American presidential candidates were rather supportive to the agreement , without failing , however , to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this extreme .
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement , particularly those that enable owners to keep their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescued by the state .
" When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some , there is nothing to congratulate .
But these measures are necessary , " he commented on the airwaves of American television .
Asked by another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan , his Republican opponent , John McCain , responded : " I would like to see the details , but I hope so . "
" The outline that I read [ show ] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can go forwards .
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable , " he said .
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts , assets at risk and unsellable U.S. financial institutions .
It comes after a 14 month crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages ( subprime ) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit titles ( PCAA ) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions .
This is a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft agreement last week .
It is believed to have come out of this impasse ever since the Democrats have agreed that certain " toxic " shares of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government , rather than purchased .
To round off the corners for everyone in Congress , a provision has also been added stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program , it could introduce new taxes to help recover its investment .
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the President deems necessary .
The other payment of 350 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress .
In exchange for its support , Washington will get stakes in the companies it has rescued , earning dividends in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed .
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the seizure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and severance packages paid to executives of companies affected .
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today , and the Senate on Wednesday .
Despite all their efforts , it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light .
Voices have indeed continued to be raised against the project yesterday , both in the Republican camp as well as by the Democrats .
" Obviously , Washington does not hear you , " said while addressing his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett , a member of the Finance Committee of the House .
" Yes , we have a serious financial problem .
Yes , solutions do exist .
But not ones that take advantage of taxpayers . "
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed " the Sceptics ' Caucus , " the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently , but reaches the same conclusion .
" Four hundred prominent professors of economics , including three Nobel Prize winners , have written to tell us : one asks the Congress not to hurry and to examine carefully the way forward , " he said yesterday .
At the same time , Europe has once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis .
After an emergency meeting , the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion Euro ( 16.3 billion U.S. ) .
The intervention of the governments of Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would renounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy since it has lost 2 billion Euro ( 2.9 billion U.S. ) in the risky mortgages crisis in the United States .
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers .
" This is not lost money , declared yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister , Wouter Bos .
In return , we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence .
It 's just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times are ahead . "
Meanwhile , across the Channel , the British government seems about to nationalize another bank hit by the financial crisis .
According to the English press , the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank Bradford and Bingley , including more than 41 billion ( 75.5 billion U.S. ) in real estate loans .
The Spanish bank Santander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank .
The Bradford and Bingley would be the second bank , after the Northern Rock , the British government will have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis .
The interview - Blood becomes safe again
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation , and its president , Dr. Francine Décary , had reason to rejoice , because Héma-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world .
And most importantly , it has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s .
As we know , national reserves managed by the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross had been infected by human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and hepatitis C during the 1980s .
Faced with this tragedy and public discontent , the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry , headed by Justice Horace Krever , which aimed at shedding light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster never happens again .
While Judge Krever delayed in filing his report , some provinces set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada .
In Quebec , the committee Gélineau has fulfilled that mandate .
In the wake of the Gélineau and Krever reports , two suppliers were created in Canada : Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Supply for all other provinces and the two territories .
" In 1998 , when Héma-Québec began operations , only 38 % of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec , remembers Dr. Décary .
The situation was discouraging .
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed , we have regained the confidence of the public , " she says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008 , nearly 94 % of Quebec 's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec .
Dr. Décary , nonetheless , thinks " confidence is something extremely fragile . "
From its inception on the 28 September 1998 , Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle .
At that time , there were in Europe with the outbreak of a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease , a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998 .
" And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood .
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a serious illness may result , in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death , one establishes an excluding action .
In April 1999 , the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused .
But a few years ago , it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood .
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense . "
In 1999 , on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing : the nucleic acid testing ( NAT ) allowed to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus , which is what previous tests were based on .
The TAN helped to shorten the silent period , which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques , the specialist explains .
It was able to reduce that period to less than a week .
Thus , it has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them .
These improvements have helped reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion .
Today , a person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV contaminated blood .
" In other words , this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone is infected with HIV .
Since Héma-Quebec each year distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products , it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs .
I believe that now we can feel at ease when receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recuperate our health , " affirmed the CEO of Héma-Québec .
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products .
One never knows what disease will emerge in the system .
As recently as last year , there appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which , like the West Nile virus , is transmitted by an insect in the blood .
We must be constantly vigilant , " continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to a secure supply , Héma-Québec must also provide them in sufficient quantities .
" The demand is increasing as the population ages .
The treatments being more aggressive , patients often need to refill in red blood cells or platelets .
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3 % of Quebecers eligible to donate blood . "
Any healthy person , aged 18 and over fits the suitability criteria to give blood every 56 days , six times a year .
On average , 14 % of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria , for example , and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is rife , they would be excluded for a period of one year .
" With these 3 % , we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals .
The shortages are very rare .
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot donate their blood .
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood , but even more so to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors .
Life today runs so fast , there is rarely time to find an hour to donate one 's blood , " says Francine Décary miserably .
With an annual budget of $ 297 million , Héma-Québec provides not only blood products , but also tissues , including bone grafts , heart valves , eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns .
These tissues are analyzed , processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec , which manages also the only bank of placental blood in Quebec .
The umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia .
" A few weeks ago , we celebrated the banking of the thousandth sample of placental cord blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year .
We should start to propose transplants at the beginning of next year , " says Dr. Décary describing this program for collecting placental cord blood as very popular .
" Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it " because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec .
A name granted to the expensive child
The written version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic bailout package has been drawn up . The draft law , applicable in several instalments , aims to purchase bad banking loans .
In the first round , half of the amount is planned to be spent .
" During the further reconciliations having come to an end on Saturday night , East Coast time , the congressional leaders managed to agree on the debate of several days , which concerned the 700 billion dollar bailout package , " the Reuters confirmed .
" We have taken an important step forward , " declared Nancy Pelosi , democratic chairwoman of the House of Representatives , adding that the only thing needed was to work out the written form of the agreement .
The compromise on the package has been supported by both presidential candidates , Barack Obama and John McCain as well .
Referring to the results of the compromise , Henry Paulson , Secretary of the Treasury declared : the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient , but further steps are still to be taken . According to Pelosi , it is not about rescuing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy .
The written form of the package has been published at 8 pm on Sunday , Washington time , at the opening time of the Asian markets ( at 2 am in Central-Europe ) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market .
The draft legislation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will be put to the vote on Monday , first in the House of Representatives , secondly in the Senate .
President George W. Bush talked to Pelosi on Saturday night , then the news on the agreement was welcomed in the White House as well .
" We are satisfied with what we have reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties in order to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy , " declared Tony Fratto , spokesman of the White House .
The programme differs from the proposal having been first submitted by the Bush-administration with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mortgage-backed securities .
Now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the USD 700 billion can be used in a way that USD 250 billion shall instantly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday . One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mortgage-backed securities . An additional amount of USD 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used .
The programme will be supervised by a separate body with the involvement of the chairman of the Federal Reserve .
On how to spend the rest of the 700 billion dollars will be decided by the Congress .
Pursuant to the law , the Secretary of the Treasury is entitled to apply a combined tactic : it can buy bad loans , mortgages , mortgage-backed securities and other types of " poisonous " credits .
The purchase can be realized on auctions or in a direct way , according to the Treasury .
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the worrisome assets will be guaranteed by the Treasury and the companies will pay fees equivalent to the expected damages .
Henry Paulson declared : pursuant to the law , the required assets are provided depending on the situation ; it might be an aid of USD 700 billion urgently needed by the American financial system , due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets , or the insurance of those , or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes .
" We will make the necessary arrangements in order to be ready for the implementation of the law , as soon as it has been signed , " he added .
The directors of the troubled banks waiting for state aid should count on that their severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang - will be restricted by the government .
The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only , limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treasury .
Restriction means that in case the Treasury purchases on auction , surtax is imposed on the golden parachute , unless the ruined bank director is sent to retirement .
In the course of buying bad loans directly , the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the amounts of managerial money are not exaggerated .
It must be added that the existing golden parachute contracts will not be amended , restriction applies only to the new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme .
" This is the first time in American history that legal restriction will be imposed regarding the remuneration of chief executive officers , " commented House Financial Service Committee Chairman Barney Frank , of the Democratic Party .
Besides , the government will be conferred with the right of holding acquisition , this way taxpayers ' risk will reduce , since they might even profit from the issue as soon as both the economy and the rescued bank is recovered .
The bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the Congress within the next 5 years , which specifies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector .
Sceptics gave voice for their doubts regarding the plan on both sides , too .
" This is not what American citizens expect from us , this will not protect taxpayers ' dollars , " stated Republican Representative Darrell Issa from California .
His Democratic colleague , Mary Kaptur declared the arrangements have been encouraged by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street .
Obscure City Street , Often Forgotten and Perhaps Soon for Sale
New York City has thousands of avenues , boulevards , streets and other byways , some famous , others merely utilitarian .
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place , mostly because they have never heard of it .
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue .
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long , it resembles a dusty alleyway more than an active thoroughfare .
There are no street signs .
It is virtually impossible to see on a standard atlas .
The street does , however , have admirers .
For instance , there is Avalon Bay , the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street .
It wants to repave Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings .
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who said they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block 's pregentrified past .
But the city 's Department of Housing Preservation and Development , which has control of the street , has no interest in holding on to it .
At a meeting of the neighborhood community board 's land use committee this month , representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street .
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the city 's hands , and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month , said Susan Stetzer , the district manager of Community Board 3 .
" There 's very little city-owned space left , and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place , " she said .
" There could be proposals to fix it up and manage it , which could be done by Avalon , but we also want to guarantee public access . "
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the little street and install seats , including some to be used by a cafe to which the developer expects to lease space .
The idea that Avalon Bay might buy the street was first made public at this month 's meeting .
Michele de Milly , a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay , said that though the company wanted to use the street , it did not necessarily want to own it .
" Avalon Bay 's principal concern is refurbishing this derelict alleyway and turning it into a public amenity , " she said , adding that the city had suggested the sale .
Seth Donlin , a spokesman for Housing Preservation , said it was indeed the city 's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency 's mission was to develop property rather than manage it .
Compared with its more colorful neighbor , the Bowery , Extra Place has left a light historical footprint .
Some believe it got its name in 1802 , when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed .
The back door of CBGB , the punk rock monument that closed in 2006 , opened onto Extra Place , and the street is perhaps best known as the setting for the cover photograph of the Ramones ' album " Rocket to Russia . "
" The ground was magnificent , " said Danny Fields , the manager of the Ramones , who took the photograph in November 1976 .
" It was filled with junk , shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels , posters , leaves , ropes . "
Some residents , including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village , have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place , arguing that the piece of public property , modest as it is , should remain public .
Others have lauded Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that ought to be left alone .
Jeremiah Moss , who runs a blog called Jeremiah 's Vanishing New York ( subtitled , " The Book of Lamentations : A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct " ) , posted part of a Talk of the Town story about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952 .
The author , Brendan Gill , wrote : " Extra Place is a narrow little dead-end street , dark even by day and marked off by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows , with week-old newspapers blowing along the gutters . "
With a few exceptions , the street looked much the same on a recent evening .
A rat skittered across the back of the street near a door that used to lead into CBGB , which is now the site of an upscale clothing store .
Graffiti was on walls and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay near a fresh batch of discarded newspapers .
A few passersby said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that it could use some sprucing up .
Mr. Fields , for his part , said he thought that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state .
" The best years of my life , " he said , " were in places that were dark , damp and disgusting . "
In a Town Apart , the Pride and Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the theme-park sprawl of greater Orlando , a few miles from the shiny , the loud and the gargantuan , lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life .
Eatonville , the first all-black town to incorporate in the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston , is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935 : " the city of five lakes , three croquet courts , 300 brown skins , 300 good swimmers , plenty guavas , two schools and no jailhouse . "
It is now a place of pilgrimage .
Alice Walker , Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora ! Festival in Eatonville to pay their respects to Hurston , the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance .
And yet in many ways , the town she described - and made a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers ' Project - remains a place apart .
It is as independent , dignified and private as it was in the 1930s , when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true thoughts with the white man , who " knowing so little about us , he doesn 't know what he is missing . "
Even now , in a year when a black presidential nominee , Senator Barack Obama , has called for an open conversation about race , many here remain wary of the outsider 's gaze .
" We 're very cautious about how our story is told , " said Hortense Jones , 59 , a lifelong resident and member of the town 's oldest church .
" It needs to be right . "
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle .
It is both a historic model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rates are twice the national average .
It is a literary hub but also an oak-shaded example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes disdained , sometimes praised - that was born of American slavery .
Not surprisingly , residents here are both proud and protective .
And the concern about Eatonville 's image really began with Zora , which is all anyone here calls Hurston .
She introduced the world to her hometown through heartfelt , dialect-heavy books like " Mules and Men " ( 1935 ) and " Their Eyes Were Watching God " ( 1937 ) .
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed the town , just off Route 17 , a road that runs through the oft-forgotten center of Florida into a stage of black history and human drama .
Bold as a bass drum in both life and literature , Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville 's first mayor , Joe Clarke , then veered into more private areas .
" Off the road on the left , " she wrote , " is the brown-with-white-trim modern public school , with its well-kept yards and playgrounds , which Howard Miller always looks after , though he can scarcely read and write . "
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " sells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transient rooms . "
So in just a few hundred words , Hurston linked Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy , remarriage and sex .
Clearly , Fodor 's this was not .
In fact , it was not a portrait everyone appreciated .
" Zora told it like it was , " said Ella Dinkins , 90 , one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing off-color songs about their beauty .
She added : " Some people didn 't like that . "
Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who frequently returned after her family moved to Jacksonville , Fla .
Augustus Franklin , 77 , recalled that when Hurston sped into town , she usually arrived without notice in a thumping Chevrolet , smoking and wearing pants in a town that even today prides itself on dignified dress .
Most residents were fascinated , Mr. Franklin said , while many sneered .
" People were always glad to see Zora , " Mr. Franklin said .
But , he added , rocking in his chair on a back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia , where Hurston was most likely baptized , " she never did stay too long . "
When Hurston died in 1960 , she was poor and her books had fallen out of print .
Along with much of the world , Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her .
Though she was once a literary star , a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s , she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce , Fla . , where she had been living .
In Eatonville , there were no major memorial services , no grand public readings .
" I don 't think they understood her contribution to the world or her legacy at all , " said Valerie Boyd , author of " Wrapped in Rainbows , " a Hurston biography published in 2003 .
A turning point came in the 1980s .
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through town to replace Kennedy Boulevard , the community 's puttering two-lane main street .
Orlando 's sprawl had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of town .
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history .
Forced integration , among other things , had ended the community 's relatively idyllic isolation .
In the 1950s , the fight over racial mixing brought hate to the community 's doorstep .
" During that time , a bunch of white boys , they would come through and throw oranges and things at people sitting down on the side , " Mr. Franklin said .
" We actually had a lady that got killed from that once .
They threw a watermelon out of the car . "
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel , Hurston questioned the Supreme Court 's demand for forced integration , calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education " insulting rather than honoring my race . "
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools , while positive in some respects , diluted Eatonville 's cohesiveness and undermined the confidence of its youth .
" Black children were accustomed to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning , you hugged your teacher at night , " said N. Y. Nathiri , the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community , a nonprofit group .
That lasted , she added , until the teachers and students did not come from the same place .
" You were not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there 's a cultural divide there , " Ms. Nathiri said .
Civil rights , however , helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers , actors and artists who rose above prejudice , like she did , with buoyant self-assurance and lines like : " How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company !
It 's beyond me . "
In 1975 , the writer Alice Walker trekked to Hurston 's unmarked grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation .
Five years later , an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookshelves , reintroducing her to the American canon .
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville 's most famous daughter had once again found the spotlight .
And this time , Hurston 's old neighbors saw her as a savior .
The community began planning in 1988 for a Hurston festival to show what the county could ruin with its highway .
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later , and each January , many return for the celebration .
After several years , the county backed away from its road proposal .
" The five-laning of the highway resurrected , it put in what you 'd call warp speed , real civic pride , " Ms. Nathiri said .
Ms. Boyd put it more simply : " Zora saved Eatonville . "
Victory over the highway project has helped change the town 's self-image .
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson , a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993 , started to appear in larger numbers , and residents started to revalue the past .
Eatonville joined the national historic registry in 1998 .
A new one-story library ( named after Hurston , of course ) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard .
Today , Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly : only six miles from downtown Orlando , it can , at times , feel like a back street in a summer rain , as small as it did when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s .
( It is 90 percent black today . )
Outsiders who come looking for Eatonville 's story , its meaning , are often still treated with caution .
Advance permission is required for most interviews , and certain things - like the murals at Eatonville 's oldest church , painted by a white man , showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed .
Many in Eatonville , like Ms. Jones , a bold , confident teacher partial to bright red , still fear that their insular community will be misunderstood .
And yet , as the Hurston festival has expanded , a heightened level of hometown pride has also emerged .
Young people , in particular , tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race : beautiful , problems and all , no better , no worse and as proud , creative , hard-working , silly and mixed-up as other racial and ethnic groups in America .
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin 's nephew , Edwin Harvey , 18 , who plans to come back to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department , which he said could use some help .
And even those who are younger , like Alondra and Alexia Kenon , 11-year-old twins from Winter Park , seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly .
" Most people , if they just drive through here , they 'll think , ' Oh , this city is nothing compared to any of the other ones , ' " Alondra Kenon said after church on a recent Sunday .
" But if you actually stop and take a moment to look at the history , it 's a very nice city . "
Rats Have Feelings , Too
When in danger , a rat or roach will run away . Does it mean they experience fear , too ?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings , as well .
But if they act the same way we do , how could it be determined whether they also experience the same feelings ?
The Internet magazine ' Edge ' has been running pieces by famous scientists for years .
In a series , SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a selection of responses to the question , ' What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it ? '
I believe that animals have feelings , as well as other modes of awareness , although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date . For that matter , we haven 't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness .
But in that case , we can at least hope , since all human brains possess the same basic configuration .
As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general , however , we are entering difficult terrain , because the hardware is not compatible .
When a rat is in danger , it does the same thing as many other animals : It plays possum , runs away or attacks .
Humans behave similarly , which leads some scientists to conclude that the subjective experience is comparable .
But I don 't believe that .
There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subjective experience onto animals .
For one thing , those circuits almost always involved in human awareness include the lateral prefrontal cortex ( due to the part it plays in short-term memory and executive and control functions ) .
This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other primates , and it seems to be entirely missing in other creatures .
So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates .
Another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man 's linguistic nature : Because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language , it 's often said that their awareness depends on it .
In that case , animals could be excluded .
But even if awareness was not dependent on language , it would certainly be affected by it , meaning that animal awareness , however it may be defined , would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness .
That 's why it is so difficult to determine what animal awareness may be like .
If you have something that , being internal and subjective , can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analyzed according to our own experience , then its study comes with significant challenges .
My explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness , but aside from that , there is another important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scientifically .
Animal awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content , and that 's exactly what 's happening in the study of the short-term memory of primates , particularly when it comes to the example of visualization .
But this approach , which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick , is concerned with the neural correlates of awareness rather than the causal mechanisms , which may or may not be identical .
Interestingly , this approach also emphasizes the significance of the prefrontal cortex for the generation of the visualization .
What does this mean for feelings , now ?
Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is triggered in a brain that 's aware of its own activity .
What we call ' fear , ' consequently , is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain ( or its effects , such as physical reactions ) is using virtual memory .
From that perspective , feelings are closely tied to those regions of the cortex which are unique to primates , and humans in particular .
In conjunction with the linguistic nature , the result are delicate emotional shades , because through words and grammar we can differentiate between states and categorize them , in order to project them onto others as well .
In contrast to this , Antonio Damasio supposes , for instance , that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations . Jaak Pankseep says something similar , but his focus is more on the brainstem .
Since this network hadn 't changed in the course of human evolution , they say , it might well be a cause of cross-species sensations .
In theory , I can 't disagree with that , but I consider it improvable .
Pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it , as well , in both cases . But how can we determine whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways ?
A roach 's response to danger is flight . Does it experience fear ?
As far as I 'm concerned , a mere similarity of actions is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences .
The neural comparison is helpful , granted : Rats and humans have similar brainstems , whereas roaches do not even have brains .
But is the brainstem responsible for emotions ?
And even if it could be proved for humans - how would one want to prove it for rats ?
I believe rats and other mammals - maybe even roaches ( who knows ? ) - have emotions .
But I wouldn 't know how to prove it .
And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours ( since human awareness is based on specific circuits and on language ) , I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats .
There is the promise of results on the neural level here , in any case , provided the same can be measured in rats and humans .
Just like I don 't study language and awareness in rats , neither do I study their emotions , given that I don 't even know if they exist .
One may consider that to be short-sighted , but I prefer to make progress , rather than to keep hitting a wall .
I just happen to be a practical emotionalist .
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop , 16 years old , is asked to introduce herself on her first day at Tachibana High School , the girls begin to giggle : The German girl is totally ' kawaii ' !
What this means ?
Sylvana is familiar with the term from reading manga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan .
' First day at school in Japan .
I was so excited .
The way to school alone gave me the jitters .
I live at the edge of Tokyo , towards Kawasaki , and the train ride to Tachibana High School is 40 minutes .
I had to find the way on my own , and luckily I didn 't get lost .
The beginning of class isn 't organized as strictly as back home in Lower Saxony .
Students begin trickling in at eight o 'clock , until a brief conference with the teacher , the ' home room , ' starts at 8 : 40 .
But before class began , it was my turn to introduce myself .
I 'm not someone who likes to talk in front of other people , mind you , let alone a class of 40 .
Because I didn 't have a school uniform yet , I was dressed in one of my host mother 's old skirts , as well as a blouse , blue stockings and black leather shoes .
In this attire , I stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly : ' Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ... ' - my name is Sylvana , I 'm from Germany and my birthday is a week from now .
At that moment , I was very glad that I 'd been learning the language for two years already .
The 31 girls in class were all whispering and giggling among themselves and waving at me , and I kept hearing the word ' kawaii . '
I already knew it from my manga .
It 's part of the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means ' cute , ' ' sweet . '
Then I scurried to my seat .
The girl beside me was smiling rather brightly . She thought it was an honor that the exchange student should be seated next to her .
The rest of class was pretty uneventful , but when the bell rang , they were all practically crowding me .
They were talking all at once and giggled and bombarded me with one question after another , even though Japanese English is really hard to understand .
Then , during the break , everybody got out their bentos .
My host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me , too - it 's something else than the bleak German lunch break sandwiches .
I had rice with herbs , little sausages , salad made from cucumber and algae , fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat .
Most of the time I don 't have the first clue what I 'm eating here in Japan .
The stuff looks weird and has a completely novel taste .
I can say this : It 's all delicious .
Well , except for the salty plums in oil , that is . Yeuch !
At Japanese schools , the bentos aren 't just lunch .
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a homemade bento that she 's fixed in a particularly fancy way to a boy , in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break .
I read about that in my manga .
I 'm looking forward to finding out whether that 's happening here , too .
' Why Japan , of all places ? , ' my girlfriends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year .
And I always told them :
' Because it happens to fascinate me . '
After all , manga have been my favorite reading material for years .
And in order to have a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them , I eventually started to learn a little Japanese , as well .
So for me it 's been a no-brainer that I would have to come here eventually .
Because I also have a penchant for tradition , manners and customs .
And those are considered very important here .
On the one hand , Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends , but on the other hand it is strict , disciplined and traditional .
And because everything is so well-organized , I haven 't felt lost yet , even though Tokyo is the biggest city I 've ever seen .
Over here in New York we all speak fluent finance
On the face of it , nothing has changed .
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from newsstands and the gargantuan television screens in Times Square , they wouldn 't realise they were standing in the eye of a storm .
They would never guess that in the glass-fronted , honeycomb offices above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York are daily having the worst " bad day at the office " since the crash of 1929 .
Delivery boys still rattle metal tea trolleys across sidewalks , ferrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings .
Latino men still shuffle between apartment buildings carrying , like human mules , 50-odd pressed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders .
Office workers still wait in line for their morning bagel at pavement food carts , and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab between 4pm and 7pm on a weekday .
It didn 't feel as if there was a crisis at all , until , with all the talk of doom and gloom , I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon .
Even though I had timed the chore to coincide with the late afternoon lull at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase , a queue of 20 or so people was already waiting in line .
Not in front of the teller windows , to withdraw cash or make a deposit , but in front of the customer service desk , where older clients order cheque books , tourists ask for directions to Macy 's department store and new customers open accounts .
Most of those ahead of me , I was to learn later from Starr , my " licensed personal banker , " were lining up for the same reason as me .
Unlike me , however , they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they commuted , from the likes of New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Staten Island .
They had taken out money from so-called thrifts ( a bit like a building society ) , credit unions and the type of hometown savings banks whose branches only operate within one state , and who say they treat customers like family .
In the past year , 15 of these banks have quietly gone bust .
In the last few days Washington Mutual , a bank with $ 327 billion of assets , went into receivership , and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on Friday night , another bank , Wachovia , with savings deposits of $ 440 billion , was on the hunt for a rescue buyer .
The office and shop workers standing in front of me , scared of another collapse , were moving their cash to a bank perceived to be a safe haven , the bank that is doing most of the bailing out on Wall Street .
Ordinary New Yorkers in the last few weeks have become fluent in finance .
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket , speaking into her phone , referred to Lehman Brothers , the bust bank , and its gaunt-looking chief executive Dick Fuld with all the familiarity as if she were bitching about an idle colleague .
And Lyn , the uniformed , fifty-something concierge of my apartment block , has changed tack from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery .
She told me , after my visit to the bank , that " I got all my savings in money market funds now .
I 've switched , I 'm not taking any risks . "
Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Probes
For years , a mysterious phenomenon has had researchers stumped : Dark matter is affecting the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers .
Experts fear that Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct .
For almost 18 years , the probe ' Ulysses ' has been flying through space .
Due to freezing fuel lines , it is now threatening to shut down .
Among scientists , a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the Swing-By Anomaly .
The swing-by is a flight maneuver during which space probes gain additional acceleration in the gravitational field of a celestial body , such as Earth .
It enables the probes to save a lot of fuel .
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens made use of this physical trick , as did the solar probe Ulysses .
But what researches have been wondering about for years is this : The objects in flight are not behaving precisely in the way we have come to expect according to the venerable law of gravitation .
Rather , there are irregularities in their speed .
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower .
To date , physicists have been unable to explain this effect .
They have dubbed it the Swing-By Anomaly .
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity , which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space , may not be entirely correct .
The American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not err , and is trying to explain the Swing-By Anomaly by way of the so-called dark matter that astronomers discovered in the universe .
' It could be dark matter existing very close to Earth that may be responsible for the anomaly , ' he writes .
Space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years .
Evidently , it emits a gravitational force whose effect on other celestial bodies is measurable .
The dark matter itself is completely invisible , however , meaning that it neither sends nor emits any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever , such as , consequently , visible light in particular .
According to the scientists ' calculations , dark matter constitutes as much as one fifth of all matter in the universe .
Baskonia gives away a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a stunning 82-91 victory on their visit to the Maccabee Electra court despite Dusko Ivanovic 's team 's heavy losses , and after the great performance by Mizra Teltovic , who was the best on his team with eight three-pointers scored ( 29 points ) , they now at the top of their group .
The Vitorian team knew to make up for the significant absences of Herrmann , Oleson , Huertas and Micov with a big dose of involvement and team work , even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory .
Additionally , their huge success from the sidelines , with 16 three pointers scored , had a lot to do with the final triumph .
The game started out in favor of the Azulgranas , who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the start .
As Vitora 's first four baskets were from the perimeter , the speculation was already that they had jumped into the Israeli net with hot wrists .
English and Teletovic were the main scorers of the 18-20 at the end of the first period .
The second quarter was more of the same , but the Alavan team opted for the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu , who was greeted with whistles and applause at his return home , to continue increasing their lead by half-time ( 34-43 ) .
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points , even though Splitter 's " six fewer " points already signaled that it wasn 't going to be the best night for the Brazilian .
But the game , despite being headed for half time , was not more decidedand the Maccabees tried to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court , and with the ' hand of Elias ' putting the pressure on , they managed to get involved in the game .
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the " yellows ' " return to the light .
More disadvantages
Ivanovic 's players , injured but far from dead , needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe , and that 's when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived , with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas , he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead ( 54-67 ) , which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 57-67 ) .
The Alavas worked themselves to the bone in the last period , and English and San Emeterio ( 65-75 ) had already made it clear that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes .
However , Pnini and Eidson , the best on their team , did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line ( 70-77 ) .
In spite of this , and with Splitter fouling out , Ivonic 's team didn 't rush , defended well , and , even though the Israelis came close at the last minute , the game ws already won and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season .
Labour defends budget tax rises
Ministers have defended the tax rises and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report against criticism from the opposition , business and unions .
The Tories said Alistair Darling " blew " an opportunity to show he was serious about cutting the deficit by delaying decisions until after the election .
The chancellor also came under fire for hitting low and middle income workers .
Among his headline proposals are a 0.5 % rise in National Insurance and a 1 % cap on public pay settlements from 2011 .
National Insurance anger
Unions have protested that low-paid workers are being penalised for a recession not of their making and warned of " problems " ahead .
The National Insurance increase - which will raise about £ 3bn a year - has angered the business community , which says it is a tax on jobs when the focus should be on economic recovery .
The increase , limited to those earning more than £ 20,000 a year , will hit about 10 million workers .
KEY POINTS OF PBR
National Insurance up by a further 0.5 % from April 2011
Economy to shrink by worse than expected 4.75 % this year
New 50 % tax on banker bonuses
1p rise in corporation tax for small firms scrapped
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension to rise by 2.5 %
According to Treasury estimates , someone earning £ 30,000 will be £ 90 a year worse off and someone on £ 40,000 will be £ 190 worse off , while someone earning £ 10,000 a year will be £ 110 better off .
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant " difficult decisions " but insisted that 60 % of the burden of extra taxes would fall upon the top 5 % of earners .
Treasury minister Stephen Timms denied the tax rises and spending cuts outlined were a " drop in the ocean " compared to what was needed .
" These are large numbers . They will deliver for us this halving of the deficit which is absolutely essential over the next four years , " he told the BBC .
Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the turn of the year .
However , Labour forecasts for future economic growth - which will influence the amount it has to borrow and how quickly he deficit is cut - have been questioned after the chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures .
In his statement , he said the economy was likely to contract 4.75 % this year - far worse than the 3.5 % decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be £ 3bn higher than earlier estimated .
' Blown opportunity '
The Conservatives , who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour 's " debt crisis , " said projected borrowing of £ 789bn over the next six years was unsustainable .
Mnisters had failed to lay out a credible plan for how they would pay this back , they added , " cynically " ducking tough choices until after the election - which must be held by June 2010 .
" They have not included anything of significance they are going to do , " said shadow Treasury minister Philip Hammond . " They had an opportunity to do it and they have blown it . "
" The all important announcements will come after the election , whoever wins it "
Roger Bootle , Deloitte
Labour insist that schools , hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts unlike under Tory proposals which would see the deficit cut faster and further .
But the Lib Dems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year not to reduce the deficit , arguing the plans were " built on sand . "
The BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson said some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation increase in some disability benefits next April - would leave the chancellor open to accusations of electioneering as the money may simply be clawed back the year after .
However , Labour insist the extra help is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010 .
' Phoney budget '
Although ministers did not publish spending details for beyond 2011 , economists said it was clear the squeeze on public spending would only begin to bite in the medium term .
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor 's figures implied substantial cuts in many areas , potentially including transport , higher education , science and defence , in the future .
" It really is holding off the pain until later , " said its director Robert Chote .
" The all important announcements will come after the election , whoever wins it , " added Roger Bootle , economic adviser to accountants Deloitte .
" This has been the phoney pre-Budget report . The markets realise this . "
Thanks a lot
After days of wine and roses from last spring , when inflation was the prevailing trend on the markets , uncertainty again rears its ugly head , which is not surprising since it is their natural state , in an environment in which agents make decisions about the naturally uncertain future .
The cure prescribed by the central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly give an open bar liquidity at close-to-zero rates so that the financial institutions would buy deductible assets .
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and , without questioning their unorthodox liquidity policy , are beginning to throw a spanner in the works as the ECB makes its yearly auction next week .
Therefore , investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such unorthodox measures , and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums .
The volatility of the stock markets and the corporate bond spreads have swiftly picked up again , even though they are far behind the extreme levels that they reached at the beginning of the year .
The states were obligated to socialize private risk , and again public debt is going to be affected .
Again there is a flight for quality and the U.S. , Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors , causing awider spread of the Eurozone countries in respect to Germany .
Spain hardly seems to have been affected by this period of instability , but that 's when Standard and Poor 's arrived and threatened a new revision , downgrading the Kingdom of Spain .
Furthermore , some uncertainty doesn 't hurt to silence defenders of moral hazard , who again tried to raise awareness of those responsible for the global economic policy by having stopped the destructive effects derived from credit restrictions on the loss of jobs , when what should be done is to declare a new Thanksgiving Day .
However , Dubai 's paints with a tribal fight between the emirs to restore power in the emirates , and we 've already seen it before in Greece .
A Government which hides the public deficit , elections and a new Government that pulls up the rug .
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi , and Socrates in Portugal after Barroso .
It doesn 't make sense that Ecofin saved Hungry from a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year , and thatit is going to let a euro member-country fail to fulfill its commitments .
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent , and make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
If , as we hope , we find ourselves before a standardized period of transient risk premiums , after some excess of leveraged positions , it would be within our expectations .
In the case of Spain , since our public debt is spreading like the European corporate bonds , we should not be worried .
If the European spreads decrease and ours continue to expand , then it would be an idiosyncratic risk for Spain .
That of Standard &amp; Poor 's is an anecdote . When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of research services to anticipate its recovery scenarios and to revise up its scenario for 2011 , including the OECD and the European Commission , they return to the fray with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy , and long life expectancy does not portend its warning .
Again , it has all the earmarks to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets , but for now , " prudence , my driver . "
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hotchief and Bouygues .
Acciona is struggling for its first highway concession in Australia , a market where it already operates as a an energy and water company .
The construction involves a 1.7 billion Australian dollar tunnel ( about 1.047 billion euros ) .
The French Bouygues and German Hotchief are its rivals .
A 5-km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane , on the east coast , has become the closest chance for Accionato settle in the countryas a construction and motorway company .
The city council wants to have it completed by the end of 2014 .
After opting for the public-private partnership ( the acronym PPP in English ) to move the project forward , in a business plan under the tutelage of Ernst &amp; Young , the administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll .
Depending on the bids submitted by next May , the planned investment comes to 1.7 billion Australian dollars ( 1.047 billion euros ) and three consortia , with a remarkable predominance of European construction firms , are competing in the final stage .
The group known as Transcity , is headed by Acciona , the only Spanish one in the competition , and its partners are BMD and Ghella .
The first is a major Australian construction company , while the second , based in Italy , is one of Europe 's leading specialists in undergroundconstructions .
The Northern District consortium is pitted against Acciona 's team , with the presence of Britain 's Laing O 'Rourke , the Australian infrastructure group Transfield , and the French construction group Bouygues .
The third and final consortium to make it through the selection process is called LBRJV , where Australia 's Leighton ( a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief , owned in turn by ACS ) , domestic Baulderstone ( owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger ) and Razel , the Gallic firm specializing in civil construction , split the capital .
The Australian infrastructures market promises big jobs and privatization , but it carries a clear start-up difficulty if it 's not leaning towards hiring a local construction company .
It is one strategy that the aforementioned Hochtief and Bilfinger , in addition to Asian shareholders , have pursued , and one that remains unresolved for the Spanish giants in the industry .
ACS barely acquired a position in that market through its 30 % stake in Hochtief , theproprietor of the aforementioned Leighton .
Asset millionaires
Acciona is bidding on a geographical location of the utmost importance for the sector , which already has a strong presence from its activity as an energy provider and the desalination business .
Among other assets , it has the largest wind farm , Waubra Wind Farm ( 192 MW ) in Victoria , and leads the corporate groupresponsible for building and managing the desalination plant in Adelaida with a budget of 700 million .
Now it intends to consolidate these two areas and exploit synergies in the fields of construction and infrastructure operations .
The underground toll road , sponsored by the Brisbane Department of Infrastructure and the Northern Link , is calledupon to connect the Toowong Western Highway with the bypass in Kelvin Grove ( see map ) through the 5-kilometer tunnel.It is a major endeavor to reduce the traffic in Brisbane .
The timetable set by the administration sets the deadline for the decision in the summer of 2010 and for the work to start in December of next year .
Although this toll road would be open for traffic in the closing months of 2014 , the work is not anticipated to be completed until 2016 .
The tunnel began to take shape in 2005 .
It will include two lanes in each direction , an electric toll system and a sophisticated ventilation system .
The Queensland government will provide 500 million dollars ( 308 million euros ) for funding .
Brisbane is already offering business to Hochtief .
Australia continues to provide remarkable commodities to Hochtief , which announced its receipt of a Government contract worth 154 million yesterday .
The firm , owned in-part by ACS , will set up the national broadband infrastructure with fiber optic cables through its local subsidiary , Leighton .
This will provide high-speed internet access to 400,000 people and will provide work for the German firm for 18 months .
Moreover , the company has transferred the project to build the 27-story high King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane.The work has yet to begin , and Hochtief has closed the sale for 129 million .
Presently , in the U.K. , more specifically in Manchester , Laing O 'Rourke will partake in the construction and operation of two schools over 25 years .
The initial investment will total 75 million euros .
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9 % of Sos
Yesterday , the Nueva Rumasa holding company sifted through the details of the bid on shares which led to the acquisition of a stake of between 25 % and 29.9 % in Sos .
It is a percentage which doesn 't require them to launch a takeover bid ( OPA ) for all of the securities .
Specifically , Nueva Rumasa is offering 1.5025 eurosper share , to be distributed over 10 years , and with a 1 % annual interest rate .
Sos shares closed yesterday at 1.85 euros ; so , Nueva Rumasa 's offer undervalued the company 18 % below the market value .
According to Nueva Rumasa , the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos .
The offer is subject to the decision of eight of the 15 advisers .
The Jerezano group is giving a period of 15 days for shareholders to express their interest in selling securities .
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer , despite Ruiz Mateos ' company saying that it had contacted a regulator .
If this comes to fruition , the payout would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is at 254.27 million .
Meanwhile , Sos is restructuring its management .
In an attempt to stay out of possible takeover bids and the legal vagaries of its former managers , the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar , it announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordana as the director of the internal audit .
It is a decision which makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company .
This is a newly created position which reports directly to the president of the group .
And not without controversy , as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of over 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers ' holding company .
In fact , it 's possible that Sos will reveal further diversions of funds in the next few months .
In regards to the Salazars ' credit , the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernandez Noriega ( representatives of CCM and Unicaja ) testified and affirmed that they approved of the diversion of 212 million without knowing where the money was going .
New tools for inspecting cars
In these days of storms and accidents , it is not only garages that are making a profit .
Every day , thousands of cars that have been in accidents are towed to a garage , where a technician must evaluate the damage and what the repair will cost .
No claim is the same , and calculating the cost of parts and labor can be a long and complicated task .
Manually calculating the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros , including parts and labor , may take two or three hours .
However , with the help of the most recent computer tools , it would take a matter of minutes .
This is why almost 100 % of technicians are using this kind of system .
Providers of services , claims solutions , and maintenance are working to compile data supplied by manufacturers , and then process it and offer it to customers as a useful tool .
In Spain , Audatex , of the North American Groupo Solera , is the industry leader ; 80 % of assessments are done using their products .
The other firms in the sector , competing in the field of data assessment and processing , are GtMotive and Eurotax .
Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple .
According to Eduardo Velazquez , the Audatex business manager , 63 manufacturers and importers are working in Spain , and each of them submits data in a different format .
Furthermore , the amount of data to process is increasing to the point where they have released more versions , variants and engines in the last five years than in the previous 15 .
When a new car hits the market , these companies get to work .
It 's very arduous work because you have to catalog each of the thousands of vehicle parts andenter in your price .
In addition , a " smart " graphic is made for each model , where you can " click " on different parts of the car .
If it is a mass-market model , the work can be ready in a week , provided the process goes quickly .
If it 's an uncommon car , it can take up to three or four months.Currently , Audatex provides comprehensive data for 99.2 % of the cars sold in Spain .
Among the most exclusive models , information is available for a Porsche , but not a Ferrari or Lamborghini for example .
As for the number of cars in circulation , it is over 99 % .
In order to document and develop the databases , Audatex has eight centers scattered around the world ( Spain , France , Germany , USA , Brazil , Mexico , China and Japan ) , and each of these specializes in a specific brand .
Its national headquarters is in Alcobendas ( Madrid ) .
There , over a hundred technicians ( usually expert mechanics ) work with three computer screens at the same time .
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in developing these databases .
Every month , 2.5 million pieces of information are added , and clients receive updates every two days .
Developing that huge flow of information lets them give these companies different applications and varied products .
The most common use focuses on maintenance and repair , but depending on the country , there are also tools to manage scrap pieces and to calculate the market and residual value of a car .
The only company with a used car guide available in Spain is Eurotax .
Audatex doesn 't offer one in our country , but it does in the United States .
In view of the products that Audatex offers , it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support available to professionals in this sector .
This company offers 10 different tools ; AudaPlus , being the flagship product , is the standard solution , designed to allow technicians to assess claims .
It includes cars , motorcycles , and light and heavy industrial vehicles .
Besides the cost of parts , it includes manufacturer estimates of repair times and paint charts .
This tool charges according to the use , for each appraisal .
The highest cost is 5.75 euros for customers who rarely use it , 10 times a month at most .
Then , every insurance company that makes thousands of assessments negotiates their price with Audatex .
Other products , like AudaVIN , facilitate the complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment that it left the assembly line with , just from its vehicle identification number .
AudaGlass focuses on the glass parts of a car , and AudaSubastas is an on-line service open to the professional sector which facilitates the bidding on vehicles calssed as write-offs .
Their statistics service is very useful for identifying trends , geo-demographic analysis and knowing standard deviations of makes and models .
You can study , for example , how many models of a particular make have gone to a shop because of malfunctions or how many have been in serious accidents in a certain period .
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company working to develop these kinds of tools .
It sells , among others , the GT Estimate , which is again designed for technicians and also provides digital images , access to parts and the manufacturer 's official prices and times .
GT Motive is a Grupo EINSA company , which was founded in 1971 as a provider of automotive services and solutions for assessing damage , malfunctions and maintenance .
The GT Appraisal Guide is its historical reference product on the market .
They work with 24,000 users in garages , 3,100 technicians and 53 insurance companies .
Its turnover has grown by 20 % per year over the past three years , and it brought in 10.8 million euros in 2008 .
Early last year , the globalization process started with the installation of an office in Paris .
Meanwhile , Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and set up shop in Spain in 1979 .
According to company sources , 62 % of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world , and the remaining 37 % in North and South America.They work with more than 900 insurance companies and 33,000 shops , 3,000 of which are in Spain .
Grupo Solera 's ( Audatex , Sidexa , Informex ABZ , Hollander and IMS ) worldwide turnover will total 557 million dollars , 3.3 % more than 2008 .
In our country , the company brought in 19.1 million euros , 7.2 % more than last year .
In 2005 , Grupo Solera was valued at 1 billion dollars on the stock exchange , and its shares are now listed for a total of 2.4 billion dollars .
It is been listed on the NYSE since 2007 and is included in Standard &amp; Poor 's reference index .
Damaged car on-line auctions
Last October , Grupo Solera bought Autoonline , an internet platform for selling cars , motorcycles , and especially damaged vehicles .
The endeavor entailed an outlay of 59.5 million euros for 85 % of the company 's capital , which would increase in the upcoming year by the remaining 15 % .
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers , with the possibility of reaching an immense international market .
This appraisal and buying and selling service is directed exclusively at professionals in the sector , such as insurance companies , technicians , renting agencies , shops , scrap yards , and professional sellers who must register before using it .
This platform was created in Germany in 1996 , and it manages more than 650,000 transactions throughout Europe , 500,000 of them in Germany .
Its major markets include Spain , Greece , Poland and Turkey .
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 technicians .
It oversees 3,000 listings a day , and around 100 new listings are added every day on the Spanish market .
Under Spanish law , a car whose vehicle identification number has been unregistered cannot be put back into circulation but can be used for undamaged spare parts .
Cars with historical value can be registered , even though they have been unregistered , after a lengthy registration process .
A shop 's estimate in four steps
With the AudaTaller tool , Audatex guarantees that the user gets an estimate in only 4 steps : identify the vehicle , look for the spare part , create an estimate and generate an estimate .
User friendliness is an essential condition for these systems , especially to convincing older technicians , who , to varying degrees , are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques .
The database includes 1,034 vehicles , 666 of which are cars , 109 sport-utility vehicles , 137 motorcycles , 78 vans and 44 trucks .
Naturally , a computer with an internet connection is needed to use it .
After identifying the model to be repaired by its vehicle identification number , an effective graphic image of the model appears , and then the necessary part is selected .
The user can include variables such as the price of labor , surcharges and discounts , and can then print the estimate for the client .
AudaTaller is not an appraisal tool like AudaPlus , but rather a reference catalog .
The main difference is that the system aimed at garages does not include labor time estimates .
The cost of using this tool in a shop is 350 euros a year , which the customer can finance .
Presently , Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional .
This is an innovation mechanics are approving of because it will enable you , for example , to select a door and turn it around to see the inside .
The bleakest outlook in the world
THE Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environment on the planet .
The ice that defines it is melting with alarming speed , taking with it life that can survive nowhere else .
Oil , gas , shipping and fishing interests have been heading into the newly open water , with diplomats , lawyers , and now authors , in their wake .
In " On Thin Ice " Richard Ellis , a writer and illustrator , paints a natural history of the icon of the north , the polar bear .
Well-versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling , he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by taking on the white bear .
Admiral Nelson 's encounter as a plucky 14-year-old midshipman fighting only with the butt of his musket is surely a myth , but others are true .
Young bears , captured as they swam after the bodies of their newly killed mothers , were caught and sent to zoos and circuses .
One early 20th-century big-top act featured 75 polar bears at once .
Even today , zoo enclosures are still typically a millionth of the area of a wild adult 's range . The climate is rarely suitable : the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat .

Mr Ellis draws on the accounts of other writers and historians , and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species .
Although banned in Norway , America and Russia , the killing continues in Greenland and Canada , where hunters in helicopters and skidoo-riding Inuit Indians both use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their quarry .
Ironically it is in the waters towards the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longest .
In his new book , " After the Ice , " Alun Anderson , a former editor of New Scientist , offers a clear and chilling account of the science of the Arctic and a gripping glimpse of how the future may turn out there .
Not that scientists have all the answers .
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately account for the speed of the changes .
It is not for want of trying .
Fridtjof Nansen 's pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century first hinted at the whirling of the ice pack .
Cold-war submarines then mapped the shifting ridges running beneath it .
Satellite surveys and large arrays of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful addition , but much is still done by hardy individuals camped out in the cold .
Mr Anderson looks in on the extraordinary , tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice , formed by trickles of briny water which gets squeezed as it freezes .
But from the bear above to the microscopic wonders within , all are doomed once the summer ice goes , which is expected to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050 .
Poker by Manuel Vicent
In ' Four Aces ' ( Alfaguara , illustrations by Fernando Vicente ) Manuel Vicent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have passed through their literary life ( and , in some cases , the other one too ) .
He does not do it in predictable or terrible ways ( biographical sketch , life and work ) , rather by looking for something that sparked the creation of the character .
The trip has its excitements , and Vincent us spares no scares or illuminations .
In addition to being an exquisite pleasure , the book is a touching invitation to be read and reread .
Here are some snippets .
On Albert Camus : " In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean wasn 't a sea , rather a spiritual instinct , almost physical , the same one I felt without giving it a name : the pleasure against the ill-fated , morality without guilt , and innocence without any god . "
On Samuel Beckett : " Nihilistic , allegorical Christian , he wrote what was in his blood , not in his intellect , between impotence and ignorance , with a dazzling poetic humor , meaningless , like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him . "
On Graham Greene : " Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years , in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse , a spiritual privilege which consisted of reaching heaven through the road of perdition . "
On James Joyce : " ' Ulysses ' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.This is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of world literature which must be scaled by the north face , which the best mountain climbers hurl themselves off time and time again . "
On William Faulkner : " He was a weird guy . "
Of himself , he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county , and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile .
" They were both dreams of grandeur . "
On Louis-Ferdinand Celine : " This writer took the deranged scream cried from a bridge by that character from Munich in order to carry his eco , under his literary form , into the depths of the night of the 20th century , and made it a journey , hiding from himself and calling on the past with a violent discourse to the worms . "
On Dorothy Parker : " One day , she kneeled and prayed : ' Dear God , I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman ' . "
On Joseph Conrad : " On his tomb were engraved these verses from Spencer : ' Sleep after toil , / port after stormy seas , / ease after war , / death after life does greatly please . ' "
On Virginia Wolf : " She also carried her depressions in her luggage .
The husband accepted it as normal when she told him that Edward VII spied on her from the azaleas and that the birds sang in Greek .
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent came before her madness . "
On Pio Baroja : " What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja ?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through the weapons of Faulkner ?
What did Cela do but abduct the glory of that man so that it would serve his own pedestal ?
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited , a device that 's only used for checking email , without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attachments or surfing the web .
It enjoyed its 5 minutes of fame in the U.S. when Times Magazine named it one of the products of the year .
Seeing it on the street is more difficult , to be honest , but the idea can be interesting , especially for children .
Unlike smartphones , the Peek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee , less than half , for example , of the iPhone 's data plan .
Given its success , the company has released two new devices : one exclusively for Twitter , the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek .
FonPeek , presented at the La Web event yesterday , is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation .
It is just as limited as its U.S. counterpart , but comes with a surprise .
The monthly service price , around 12 euros a month , includes roaming throughout Europe .
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it 's like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi ( or a Fon connection ) to check their mail .
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited .
Yes , some operators have special arrangements and travel plans , but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print .
The repeated twisting of the European Commission 's arm to get affordable roaming rates across Europe has had almost no noticeable effect .
There 's a fear of using data outside one 's home country , and rightly so .
For a gadget like the FonPeek ( it no longer seems strange that it is called Fon since it lacks WiFi ) to get this kind of fee , it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of recouping the cost of their data networks .
The Kindle is another good example , including a book downloading feature and other internet queries .
No contracts , no bother .
It 's a connected device and is paid for when it 's purchased , not month by month .
And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek , a call option with life-time access , which the Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I 'm going to buy it .
I check my mail on my phone , thank you .
I hope so because I think it 's an unfair model for the consumer .
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system .
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their latest and most precious gem , the Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and succeeded in trimming it by no less than 80 kilos , making the total weight a mere 1,275 kilos .
This led them to , first , cutting out the automatic roof , which has been substituted by a manually-operated canvas one , saving 21 kilos ; using aluminum doors , like those on the GT3 , ' dropping ' another 15 , removing the climate control , 13 ; reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters , earning 7 more kilos ; mounting sporty bucket seats , another 12 , and with the 19-inch lightweight wheels , five .
Finally , foregoing the CDR-30 sound system brought it down another 6 kilograms , and changing the door handles to fabric ones cut the remaining kilo .
Even though it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch shift , the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual transmission , mainly on the back roads of California and along stretches of really windy mountain roads .
Its performance can only be described as flawless .
The reduction in weight does not imply that the car doesn 't grip the asphalt .
Rather the complete opposite : it has been some time since we tested a model so small and light , which , in turn , transmitted so much confidence when cornering , even at high speeds .
It is a small athlete , able to warm up its muscles in a low gear for as long as we need , until ordered to sprint , to brake , to recover and go back to exploiting its engine ...
Just what we asked for . Thanks to its steering , as communicative as it is precise , what we tell it with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do .
And it will do it with surgical precision .
Optional engine noise
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 horse power ( 10 more than the Boxster S ) is well made and can be enhancedwith the ' sport ' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine , which debuted earlier in the Panamera .
The acceleration is brutal , either from a standstill or recovering .
The suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable .
The asphalt of the highways we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was fairly beaten up , but the car handled the potholes well .
The electronic aids hardly showed up on the course ; that is because , well into the morning , we found early morning ice and gravel on some curves .
In short , it is an ultra lightweight car , one of the most fun to drive on the market , andis a bit more than just a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 , priced at 70,931 euros .
University courses to be cleared out
Partial success for students : After a year of educational strikes , the culture ministers of the states finally came around on Thursday : At a meeting of the Culture Minister and University Principals Conference , both parties agreed to improve the conditions of studying for bachelor and masters courses .
The students should , in the future , be in a position to master their studies .
In particular , they agreed to reduce the number of exams : Every module shall , as a rule , be completed with one single exam .
In addition , the students ' workload shall be reviewed and " a realistic and acceptable extent " ensured .
Politicians and colleges also want to simplify the recognition of exams taken between the colleges inside and outside Germany .
The states undertake to organise more flexibly joint structural requirements for bachelor and masters courses .
State regulations deviating from this , shall not be imposed .
Less exams
Since the start of the student protests in June , culture ministers and university principals have been referring to the dictum of better studiability .
Now it is being filled with specific contents for the first time .
The so-called accreditation council has decided to , in part , dramatically reduce the number of exams : " Every module ends , as a rule , with an exam , " states the 30-page paper , which is to newly govern the admission of courses in part .
With the " clear reduction of the examination load , " explains accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm , " an undesirable development is to be stopped , which had a grave impact on studiability . "
In addition , " studiability " is to be the core criterion for the organisation in the future .
Modules and contents " shall be strictly reviewed " as to whether " unnecessary constrictions on the students in their choice of
events " would be avoided .
The students are " entitled to be granted leeway allowing and promoting initiative . "
The rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the review of existing courses .
They need to be " reaccredited " every five years , which , however , means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed .
Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany oversee this , which report to the Accreditation Council set up by the states .
The culture ministers had " expressly " urged the states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too large and the exams regime not too strict .
In some federal states , universities and colleges have already agreed on corresponding measures with the state ministries .
Rhineland-Palatine has promised additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process ; so far , it is the only state to do so .
With this money , the colleges are , in particular , to set up tutor programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exams and foreign offices .
The state and colleges plan to earmark 10 million euros for this .
In early 2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the Universities Act before parliament .
According to it , only one exam should be necessary to complete a course model .
The course design is to become more flexible , while the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier along with access to masters courses .
By the end of the coming year , all courses of the state are to be examined for their studiability .
The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday .
On top of praise , there was also criticism for the decisions .
The federal board of the Young Socialist University Groups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place " behind the closed doors " of ministers and university principals .
After the educational strike , at the latest , students should now also " have their say " as those affected .
The future academics received support from the president of the Conference of University Principals ( HRK ) , Margret Wintermantel : " We need the experiences of the students , " she said on Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers , with whom the HRK was debating a joint reform paper .
The Education and Science Union ( GEW ) deemed the Bonn decisions to be not radical enough : It is demanding a legal claim , which would allow every graduate with a bachelor degree admission on a further masters course .
On the other hand , the states must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor students there are sufficient places on master courses with best-possible studying conditions , says GEW executive board member Andreas Keller .
The states must employ significantly more lecturers .
The culture ministers did , however , not issue a statement regarding free admission to masters courses .
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs : The animal , standing two metres tall and with a length of 1.50 metres on two strong hind legs , had a longish skull with sharp , curved teeth , short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail .
If the species had lived a couple of million years later , it would not be anything special .
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with such physical features , reports Sterling Nesbitt and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin in Science magazine of Thursday .
The animal lived about 215 million years in what is today New Mexico , which was back then in a dry zone of the super continent Pangaea at the equator .
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs , says Nesbitt .
It reveals a great deal about the relationships , the spread , and the features of early dinosaurs .
In 2006 Nesbitt and the other palaeontologists started an excavation on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico .
" On some days we found dozen dinosaur bones , that is exemplary for sediments from the Triassic period , " reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History .
The scientists identified some bones quickly .
During the excavations , they collected the remains of a total of five creatures .
Find confirms theories on early dinosaur history
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians .
For Sterling Nesbitt , it is an exceptional find : " Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic period are extremely rare . Mostly , only individual fragments are found . "
Other dinosaur researchers do not quite share this enthusiasm .
" This find is not particularly spectacular , but it does confirm some theories on the early history of dinosaurs . " says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn , for instance .
According to current doctrine , the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago .
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete , for which reason the classification of these primal dinosaurs is highly contentious .
As such , the experts debated , for instance , when the saurians split into the three most important lines of development : the carnivorous theropods , which later included Tyrannosaurus rex , the Velociraptor and birds , the four-legged sauropods known as the " long necks " and their relatives , and the plant-eating Ornithischiae ( bird-hipped saurians ) , which included , for instance , the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species .
According the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues , Tawa Hallae is a primal theropod .
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties , says Nesbitt .
On the skull of Tawa Hallae , for instance , the scientists found indications of air bags , as the descendants of the theropods , birds , have .
Thanks to the air bags , the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals .
Tawa Hallae 's bones of the spine were obviously also partly filled with air .
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags , says Randall Irmis .
As the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones , the joint ancestor of these two groups will probably have come up with this useful innovation .
At least three migration waves to North America
As the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America , the scientists come to the conclusion that the saurians appeared there first .
Accordingly , the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the planet , which still formed a single land mass as the super continent Pangaea .
This theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more theropods which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of Tawa Hallae .
The three cannot possibly descend from a common ancestor . So they must have migrated there , is the scientists argument .
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America , says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , a co-author of the Science study .
But there are of course contradictions .
An older species , Silesaurus , which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs , lived in what is today Poland , says the Bonn-based palaeontologist Martin Sander .
He believes that a distorted picture may emerge simply because a high number of primitive dinosaur fossils have survived over the years , while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents .
How dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sidearm of the reptile tree to become the ruling tetrapod vertebrate of the Mesozoic , is still anybody 's guess .
During the Triassic period , the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with a large amount of other reptiles , for instance with the ancestors of today 's crocodile and pterosaurs and with numerous other saurians .
Towards the end of the Triassic period , the dinosaurs spread across the globe and developed many new species , while their relatives died out on the threshold from the Triassic to the Jurassic periods .
Success story did not last for ever
There are two theories to explain this switch , says Martin Sander .
There may have been a case of mass dying , which the dinosaurs randomly survived but not the other reptiles .
Or the dinosaurs were better adjusted , meaning that they were able to beat off the competition .
In any event , the success story did not last for ever .
150 million years later , a meteorite impact helped a group of animals , which had also developed back in the Triassic period and since lived in the shadows to blossom : the mammals .
Recycling containers don 't smell so good in Brno
In Prague , normal people can sort their beverage bottles , and , in South Moravian , villages are recycling containers on every corner .
And in Brno ?
There , it will take you a good few minutes to find the right sort of bin .
I don 't mean to imply that garbage isn 't sorted in Brno .
But it seems to me that considering we 're the second largest city in the country , the authorities are not showing enough interest in this problem .
Brno is falling way behind in its garbage sorting , not only because people here can still only put paper , glass and plastic into these bins , but mostly because of the sheer lack of containers for this kind of waste .
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle into a bin in the city centre ?
It 's a real art form , and you need time and steady nerves .
The only place we 've managed to come across is on Moravské náměstí , opposite the Potrefená Husa .
No offence to Mr. Onderka and his colleagues , but it 's really not good enough .
Not to mention that it 's no easy task sorting garbage in other parts of the city .
Plenty of my friends don 't bother sorting their garbage .
Out of laziness .
It 's just too far to the bin , you see .
I don 't blame them .
After a party , I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles .
But , on Kounicova ulice , there were no coloured bins to be seen .
Luckily , on the way to the tram , I found the right place .
But it was overflowing with garbage .
Come on , this is the centre of Brno . Isn 't it supposed to look good ?
It should , but ecology and aesthetics don 't seem to interest the Brno socialists much .
They prefer to buy the city a new hockey extra-league , which puts us to shame all over the country , instead of buying a few more containers and letting us sort other garbage for a cleaner Brno .
I 'm glad to see that , after browsing the net for a while , my assumptions are confirmed by official statistics .
Figures published by EKO-KOM show that Brno really is the worst off in the whole of South Moravia .
" Paroubek 's " budget takes money for pensions and sick pay
The fact that the left gave extra money to the farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there might not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions , sick pay , or building society savings .
And also not enough for interest on the national debt or to cover international judicial disputes .
This will bring problems for whoever is in office in the latter half of next year , said the Finance Minister Eduard Janota .
When the social democrats and communists raised interest rates for certain groups , they were relying on the fact that the government would loan money for susceptible expenses , pensions , and sick pay . " It 's just a case of postponing the problem , laying a minefield , " says Janota .
Higher interest has to be paid on loaned money , and , at some point , it has to be paid back .
The state does not have much choice where to find it .
If it doesn 't reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state , it will have to increase taxes .
For all those that the left just handed out money to : firefighters , teachers , farmers .
And later , their children , too .
People don 't have to worry about pensions or sick pay , where 1.8 billion has disappeared from the accounts ; they 'll get them .
Although , at the cost of the state falling deeper into debt - next year the treasury won 't just be 163 billion short , but even more .
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota , debt will continue to increase at an ever faster rate , as will interest costs .
The state will need money to cover it , and it 's no longer enough just to slightly bump up VATs or reduce maternity benefits , as the government has done in its anti-deficit package .
As money has been diverted to several groups of voters , next year there will also be a shortage of five billion for building highways and railways .
These are mostly sections that have been tendered out and are half-finished and cannot be redesigned or made any cheaper .
At the most , conserve what isn 't free too .
This means that delaying or halting thirty major building projects and money from European funds is also at risk , warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka .
The ČSSD has suggested that the deficit be resolved Solomon-style - it should draw on ČEZ dividends , which are mostly state-owned , and use those to top up the transport fund .
The problem is that the level of these dividends is never certain , and they are certainly not a bottomless resource .
Last year , 18 billion of ČEZ money went into the budget .
Every year , these dividends are used to pay for clearing up ecological damage , topping up the pensions account , or are set aside as a reserve for the upcoming pension reforms .
Moreover , according to EU regulations , this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP .
But this is not the end of these transfers .
The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of communism and crime , to meet the cost of judicial disputes , and even to cover building society savings .
It is still not clear if the state can get by without this money .
It 's a gamble .
If we were to lose an international dispute , we 'd still have to pay , claims Janota .
The minister will then have to save money within the resort or , in the worst case scenario , reach into the government 's budget reserve .
The two-billion-crown State Treasury project , which is already underway , is also lacking a hundred million , and what each office is spending can be followed on-line .
The first stage will start in January .
If the finance minister can 't find the money elsewhere , the project will have to be aborted and sanctions will be imposed , warns Janota .
Lack of snow in mountains causes problems for hoteliers
It 's not only Krkonoše ski-lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes .
The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses .
This means vacancies are still available in the Krkonoše throughout the winter , including Christmas and New Year 's Eve .
We 're getting plenty of visitors to our site .
People are browsing the offers , checking prices , but , so far , are worried about making a definite booking .
" When they call , the first thing they ask is if we think they 'll see snow or mud , " says Martin Jandura , who runs the Spindl.Info information web site .
Anyone who wants to spend New Year 's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn just how they want , had better start thinking about booking soon .
Those preferring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days .
Hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn are so far just offering week-long stays for New Year 's Eve .
I think they 'll try to keep that up for a while , but even they will give in and offer shorter stays .
Then there 'll be a sudden shortage of vacancies , " estimates Jandura .
The Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours is still offering vacancies throughout the winter .
What we 're interested in is Christmas week , which hasn 't sold out yet .
Half of our capacity is still available .
That 's why we 've been preparing some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks , " said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert .
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year 's Eve in the Krkonoše , but there are fewer vacancies .
Another good time for bookings is the first fortnight in February , although bookings for the remaining winter dates tend to be average .
This year , interest in winter breaks is low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Krkonoše .
People are waiting to see if any falls .
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains when there 's no snow .
If snow falls on the slopes this week , Christmas will sell out too , " says Schiefert .
On the other hand , the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou has seen better bookings this year than last year .
We 're up about 5 percent .
We have the last few vacancies for New Year 's Eve and Christmas .
There 's a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January and we usually get plenty of bookings in February too , " explains the director of the best hotel in Pec , Karel Rada .
The Omnia Hotel , by the central car park in Janské Lázně , is eighty-percent booked up for New Year 's Eve .
Yet the newest hotel in Janské Lázně still has half its beds free for Christmas .
January this year has been a nice surprise , as we 're already sixty-percent booked up .
So February isn 't looking quite so good , but as soon as it snows , then interest in staying in the Krkonoše will definitely rise , says the owner of the Omnia Hotel , Erik Sporysch .
For now , however , the Krkonoše hoteliers will have to wait for heavier falls of snow .
Colder weather is forecast for Thursday , so if anything falls , it should be snow .
But it should get warmer again after that , said Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Hradec .
Road freight : three marathons for one agreement to save Christmas deliveries
Following three marathon sessions of negotiations , transport unions and the TLF , the only employer 's organisation to have remained to the end , reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on Christmas deliveries .
During the signing on Friday evening , Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau was " delighted " with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning .
After a second night of discussions , negotiating sides left in the small hours with the hope of a swift signing of the agreement 's text later in the morning .
And this , despite three employers ' organisations ( FNTR , UNOSTRA , OTRE ) having slammed the door .
However , it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11am for everyone to be in agreement , and for the text to be signed at 6pm .
The disagreement " would have been very damaging for the companies " and " it looked like it might threaten the end of year festivities , " Mr. Bussereau stated .
The document allows for a 4 % increase in salaries for the lowest ones ( in local and regional road transport ) , and a 2.9 % increase for higher ones ( international transport ) .
Hourly rates , for those on lower pay , " go from 8.72 euros to 9.06 .
It is not much , but we have come a long way , explains Patrice Clos ( Worker 's Union ) .
This evening we will give the order to our campaigners not to form blockades or picket at delivery depots .
There may , however , always be a few difficult ones , who remain uncooperative , he added .
Philippe Grillot , president of the TLF , paid tribute to " a good agreement , " even if it was " difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition . "
According to him , the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones .
It is a common sense agreement , respecting the workers , declared Maxime Dumont ( CFDT ) , while Thierry Douine ( CFTC ) praised it as " a historic agreement . "
As for Richard Jaubert ( CGT ) , he described it as " an acceptable compromise . "
The agreement also allows for a rise in travel expenses of 3 % and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010 , which will give room for dealing with the questions of a 13th month 's pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement .
Mr. Bussereau reminded everyone that " a 100 million euro cut in employers ' charges " had been the subject of a Government amendment in corrective financial legislation for 2009 , voted on in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly .
The Government will ask that the Senate vote on it " in the same timeframe . "
The signature from the TLF allows the agreement to be applied in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation , and secondly , to the whole profession , subject to it being extended by the Minister for Labour .
It will be done " in a very short time , " assures Mr. Bussereau .
The opposing employers ' organisations can only delay the process .
The FNTR called it a " sham , " because the 100 million euros " had already been promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax . "
The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the negotiating table , not with the aim of a two-sided review , but to avoid upsetting the turkey-eaters this Christmas , deplores the UNOSTRA .
For the OTRE , the agreement risks " digging the graves of a large number of the sector 's SMEs over the next 12 months . "
A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence ?
If nothing changes in the way France 's biggest enterprises are run , our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in vain ...
For over ten years , the Management 's attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution : employees should be made to adhere to " values " dictated from above just as it was in the past , when products dreamed up by the factory 's engineers were dropped on the consumer .
By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation , the marketing revolution put the strategies for conquering markets the right way up again ... even if authoritarian temptation to impose products , which are disconnected from the preferences of the consumer tend to resurface regularly !
A demobilisation of employees can lead to terminal demoralisation .
Suicides at France Telecom , PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular .
Demobilisation gravely compromises the development of an organisation 's strategic functions , notably in R &amp; D , but even more so in competitive intelligence .
Indeed , CI " demands from all sides concerned ( ... ) a proactive approach and a long-term vision " ; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods .
For this reason , we are calling for a management revolution , which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise 's concerns alongside consumers .
The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods ?
Unfortunately , I fear it will not .
- Firstly , because I have witnessed that , when faced with a new situation , any organisation will arrive , after many detours , at doing chiefly ... what it always does !
- Next , because authoritarianism - a disease of power - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures .
- Finally , because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour .
Coming from the top technical educational establishments , they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology .
They adopt , for intellectual convenience , the old behaviourist theory , which has recently been re-awakened by the " neuro-sciences " of the United States that have been widely and silently diffused by business institutes and the Media .
In this way , by suggesting that " levers " [ sic ] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff , a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr cradles leaders into a position of mechanistic governance , which is unsuited to the world of today .
Identify and quantify mobilisation factors
In contrast , the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises supposes the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behaviour .
It consists in the integration , within all management strategies and practices , of a fundamental admission : for employees , commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to realising a part of their dreams , their ambitions , and their plans .
Currently , only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation .
These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-determined consensus of opinion , which allows them , by means of this perceived view , to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans .
By identifying and gauging these mobilisation factors , enterprise leaders can control , predict and anticipate their " social performance " and turn their management of resources " the right way round . "
They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence .
The UDF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its acronym
The UDF alliance , controlled by François Bayrou 's Democratic Movement ( MoDem ) , reacted on Friday to the buy-out bid made by the New Centre 's president , Hervé Morin , for the acronym of the former Giscardian party , by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances , threatening legal action otherwise .
Hervé Morin announced publicly that he intended to recoup the UDF acronym , ruling that François Bayrou was not worthy of its political heritage , having extended his hand to the Left .
The Defence Minister , whose party is partner to the UMP , had in fact planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC 's national Council .
In support of his move , he received backing from deputy Hervé de Charette ( ex-UMP switched to NC ) , who claims his ownership of the UDF trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the National Industrial Property Institute .
However , Friday evening , the UDF Alliance 's office , headed by François Bayrou 's friends , who do not plan to give up possession , has come out of silence to launch an attack against the deputy , ordering him not to use the acronym , and to transfer the trademark 's ownership to them , otherwise threatening legal action .
In the last few days , you have stepped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to regain the UDF acronym , the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office , including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem , as well as the senator , Jean Arthuis , from the centre Alliance .
You also thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website 's homepage the movement 's name , the New Centre , and to follow it with the slogan : today 's UDF , remark those who signed the document .
As you are well aware , you have no right to the use of the acronym , explains the UDF 's office , requiring that the NC remove " immediately any mention of the UDF name from all material , and from ( their ) internet site . "
He also requests that Hervé de Charette " transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners . "
If you failed to do this , the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of UDF members were respected , warn the document 's signatories .
In their communication , they specify that the UDF " is a political movement in its own right since 1978 " and points out that Mr. Morin and his friends had " made their choice " to leave him in 2007 " to create a competing movement , as others had done in 2002 , to establish the UMP . "
The New Centre , according to them , has therefore no right to the use of the UDF acronym ( Union for French Democracy ) .
They also remind that the UDF 's last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the MoDem for three years , and for the creation of an office charged with defending " the material and moral interests " of the body founded by Valéry Giscard d 'Estaing .
As for Hervé de Charette , the office continues , " when he registered the trademark , " he had " not been a UDF member for three years , " but , in fact , with the UMP .
He is profiting in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the UDF acronym by taking it to benefit his own account .
This incident is turning into a major offence , they state , before adding ironically about the NC 's strategy that : " in our opinion , in politics as in real life , it is more dignified to make one 's own name rather than try to become somebody by fraudulently acquiring a name we have no right to . "
Miss World pageant once again in South Africa
After a month-long trek across South Africa , the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to make their dream come true : to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers .
During this grand beauty congregation organised for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg , five of them have already landed their tickets to the semi-final .
Miss Japan , Eruza Sasaki , Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico , Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone , Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar , and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected Miss World Sportswoman or also Miss World Top Model during their African stay .
It was a real whirlwind .
To visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth , Durban , and Cape Town is extraordinary .
I saw so many things and I have so much new experience , said Miss of Sierra Leone .
This competition , which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time , will be transmitted live on Saturday from Midrand , north of Johannesburg , starting at 17 : 00 ( 15 : 00 GMT ) .
I could not have dreamed of a better country to award my crown .
The experience was fascinating .
I am pleased to have been able to live it twice , points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer .
For the young Russian , her second visit to South Africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re-discovery " of landscapes in this country that take your breath away . "
After a month of galas , rehearsals , press meetings , and safaris , the Miss candidates are concentrating on the competition .
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra , elected in 2000 and present at this vote , as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994 , both of whom have become stars of Bollywood .
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world , but it is not all about appearance .
We are ambassadors for our countries and I want to return home with the crown , asserts Miss India with a broad smile .
According to organisers , music and dance will mark this 59th edition .
Candidates will parade in traditional outfits and , of course , in swimsuits .
The show will be presented by Angela Chow , an ethnic Chinese television presenter , the South African ex-beauty queen Michelle McLean , and an officer from the Miss World Committee , Steve Douglas .
South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better , affirms Julia Morley , president of Miss World .
The candidates went on safari , as they did last year , visited the famous township of Soweto , but this time by bicycle , and sampled the local cuisine .
Exceptionally , they also met the South African president , Jacob Zuma , who shook their hands .
Unusual for a head of State , notes Miss Sierra Leone .
Their most beautiful memory will probably be the World Cup draw in Cape Town ( Southwest ) for football in June 2010 , a way for the country to promote the event a little more .
I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach .
I will without a doubt be returning for the 2010 World Cup , enthuses Miss Italy , Alice Taticchi .
Jančura files a slander suit against three ČSSD commissioners
The owner of Student Agency , Radim Jančura , will today file a slander suit against three social democrat commissioners .
These are Michal Hašek , commissioner for South Moravia , Radko Martínek , commissioner for Pardubice , and Olomouc commissioner Martin Tesařík .
Jančura announced this in the Twenty Minutes programme on Radiožurnál .
The suit relates to the company 's attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions .
However , all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways .
So now all three commissioners are attacking us and saying that we 're getting the best out of it , while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted .
They claim that we 're more expensive than Czech Railways , which is not true , as we know the Czech Railways prices that were concluded last week .
So all we can do is defend ourselves .
It 's for slander against Student Agency , Jančura told Radiožurnál .
He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law .
He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission .
Hašek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jančura 's great media show , which works as a free advertisement for himself and his company .
It 's understandable that I 'm prepared to defend my good name and that of my region , and I call upon the other commissioners to do the same .
I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments , said Hašek .
Last week , Jančura said that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities .
He told Radiožurnál that he was halting the campaign for Christmas and would restart it in the New Year .
He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such .
Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order , worth around 150 billion crowns .
According to Jančura this is illegal and in contravention of the principles of the European Court of Justice .
Jančura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the ČSSD .
The only threat was that if we don 't stop this , we could lose our bus licence .
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD , I know who it was but I 'm not going to say his name , Jančura told Radiožurnál today .
Vaccinations against pneumococcus will be free and voluntary .
Starting January , vaccinations against pneumococcus will radically change ingrained habits .
These should be the first free yet voluntary vaccinations for families .
But some are saying that compulsory vaccinations would be more effective .
Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak .
The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum price for vaccines to be paid for by health insurance companies .
Experts are now clear on how to proceed with the vaccinations .
New vaccinations
Vaccines free of charge for children born in August
Starting January , there could be free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children born on or after August 2nd .
The condition is that they have not received any prior vaccinations .
Anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-vaccinations .
The first batch of vaccinations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old .
Last year , one in four families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcus .
Parents paid 1600 crowns or more per vaccination .
The youngest children require four vaccinations .
Overall , experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccinations .
But they save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need .
So far , the state has been paying around 500 thousand crowns a year on all general vaccinations for children .
Subsidised vaccinations were introduced as part of the Janota package .
Pneumococcus causes infections of the middle ear , but also serious infections of the cerebral membranes and blood poisoning .
Pneumococcal infections claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every year , according to hospital figures .
Besides the Czech Republic , around 40 countries have introduced general anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children .
Will vaccinations be compulsory ?
Some believe that in the future these vaccinations could be compulsory .
As of January , they should be paid for by the insurance companies and not compulsory .
The head of the Nahlas civil association , Rudolf Kalovský , says that compulsory vaccinations would be better .
His association has long been promoting pneumococcus vaccines .
The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vaccinations .
It 's not completely ideal .
On the other hand , we 're happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vaccinations in place .
I think this is the route we have to take , said Kalovský .
The Ministry of Health , however , does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination system .
We 're not considering it at this time , said ministry spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň .
Voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks , say doctors
The chairwoman of the Professional Society of Paediatricians , Hana Cabrnochová , acknowledges that voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks .
If all children were vaccinated , the number of revaccinations could then be cut . " With vaccines costing so much , we can understand the political decision that vaccinations should be offered on a voluntary basis , " says Cabrnochová .
Experts assume that , starting next year , more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus .
The anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are a milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies , not the state .
Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment , explains Cabrnochová .
Doctors will have to buy vaccines themselves
However , practising paediatricians are concerned when it comes to buying the vaccines .
According to the original plan , the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies , and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations .
Some ministers , however , are worried that the insurance companies could " run wild with health insurance funds . "
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money .
It is estimated that practising paediatricians will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vaccines , which is a lot of money .
It certainly won 't be easy , says Cabrnochová .
Hyundai obliges unions . All overtime is cut
The management of the Hyundai car plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cut all overtime .
It is because of all this forced overtime that the unions have declared a strike on Monday .
This was confirmed by the Hyundai spokesman , Petr Vaněk .
The management , however , wants to come to an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year .
We can 't give up on our production plan , it 's essential , so we have proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday December 19th , involving two shifts , said Vaněk .
The website Sedmička.cz wrote that the firm had offered all employees who are to work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK .
This bonus will also be paid retrospectively to those who worked on Saturday November 28th .
According to Vaněk , the firm has decided to change how it motivates its employees to take the proposed overtime .
Either they 'll claim the additional wage for the overtime or they can take time off in lieu on December 28th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day , said Vaněk .
Additionally , all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for .
Considering that overtime was the most pressing and thorny question for the unions , as well as for the protesting employees who brought production to such a grinding halt last week , the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime for December , said Vaněk .
Until last week , virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours ' overtime on top of their normal eight-hour shifts .
After signing the agreement , the trade unions will call off the strike
Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning .
On Wednesday , the head of the unions , Petr Kuchař , said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document , they are willing to call off the strike .
The situation at the plant deteriorated sharply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the incessant overtime .
They were also protesting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution .
The management responded by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the demand for cars .
In Monday 's announcement of the strike , the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who halted production last Wednesday .
The trade unions are asking the firm to keep overtime to a minimum .
Moreover , this year they are requesting that a 5000 crown bonus be paid for this work .
The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice now employs 2000 people .
The firm began series production last November .
By this September , it had made around 80,000 cars , and its current capacity is 200,000 vehicles a year .
Mandela played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood 's new film
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus will tell the world a lot about their country , its struggle and its victories , despite some people criticising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors .
It is a story about sport , race relations , and Nelson Mandela .
The life of the tireless fighter against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president , Nelson Mandela , is played by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman .
Freeman said that he had asked ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in Eastwood 's film .
Another leading role in the film is played by Matt Damon .
I told him : ' If I 'm going to play you , I 'll need access to you . "
The seventy-two-year-old actor , who won an Oscar for his role in Eastwood 's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby , has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-slavery movement who eventually himself became a slave , a fictitious president of the USA , and even a god in Evan Almighty , but has only rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and means so much to people as Mandela .
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in South Africa .
He was released in 1990 and was then the country 's president for four years .
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
Invictus is Latin for ' unconquered ' and is the name of a poem by the English writer William Ernest Henley , published in 1875 .
The challenge was to speak like he does .
The film tells the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team , Francois Pienaar , to help unify the country . The newly-elected President Mandela knows that , after apartheid , his nation will still be racially and economically divided .
He believes that he can unite people through sport , so he decides to unite the rugby players who , to the world , are outsiders .
The South African team eventually makes it through to the World Cup in 1995 .
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela 's story onto the big screen .
My only aim was to play this role as realistically as possible , said Freeman .
Naturally , the greatest challenge was to speak like Mandela .
The actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park , he would try to meet Mandela , go for dinner with him , and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches .
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela 's hand .
I found out that when I take your hand , I draw on your energy , it flows into me , and I feel that I know how you are feeling , he said .
For me it 's important to try and become a different person .
In the film , Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar , the captain of the national rugby team , which was dominated by white players .
The actor said that he had six months in the tough world of rugby to prepare for the role .
It turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his home .
I remember ringing his doorbell , he opened it , and the very first thing I said to François Pienaar was : ' I look much bigger on the screen . '
Despite the evident differences in the stature of the actors compared to their real-life counterparts , under Eastwood 's direction , Invictus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an Oscar nomination .
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up the film by saying : " It was a great story , a very well-made film . "
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com , Invictus has a 76 percent positive rating .
USA : Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It 's almost funny to see how Barack Obama , reputedly the wisest president , is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor , having himself considered him to be the most foolish .
When he finally came out with his long-awaited Afghan doctrine , it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush 's Iraq scenario three years earlier .
It 's not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words " just like in Iraq , " but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush 's declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration : " The new way forward . "
While three years ago he himself criticised Bush 's idea to send fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in Iraq as " an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences . "
The following months , however , showed that Bush 's strategy , which was recommended by his field commanders , was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about Iraq .
It didn 't help Bush 's reputation , but in objective terms , it left his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected .
Barack Obama hopes that , in Afghanistan , the miracle will repeat itself .
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by his field commanders , particularly the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McChrystal , who even went against the custom of his subordinates to harshly criticise the reluctant gunners in the White House .
He asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around .
The president hesitated for three months , but failed to come up with anything better , and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers .
He managed to squeeze a promise out of Europe for another 5 thousand , even though he himself was originally counting on 10 .
The trickiest aspect of Obama 's strategy seems to be his plan to start pulling troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process within three years . Obama 's doctrine as a whole calls for more questions than it answers .
Many doubt that this half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq .
Despite the internecine war of recent years , Iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been honouring the treaties .
The Afghan situation is just the opposite - nobody can be relied upon and no treaties are being upheld .
In these conditions , it is hard for the Afghan security forces to prepare , being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves .
Political institutions , no matter how formally they might be set up , will be nothing more than a Potemkin village in which patriarchal tribal relations will run wild .
Balancing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is unusually difficult due to the tricky relations between them , a fact which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran .
Even building an " operational state , " which is the most basic aim of the entire operation , does not seem particularly feasible .
The timing of Obama 's strategy is foiled by his voluntarism .
Over the last eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse , and is now on the verge of exploding .
Only a truly romantic soul , totally unaffected by reality , could believe that the soldiers sent into the turmoil of this war for an " early return home " will bring about any miracles here .
From a political viewpoin , t it is pure irresponsibility setting a date for withdrawing the troops , as the Taliban will see it as indirect acknowledgement of an American defeat .
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the European people to take part in the operations in Afghanistan is waning .
European politicians cannot and are unwilling to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush .
Another factor which could radically stir things up is what is going on around Iran .
If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions against Iran have no effect , the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation using military force or not .
This will need answering when , according to Obama , America orders the victorious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan .
Any such solution will obviously also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation .
The only saving grace for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections , so there 's still enough time for him to come up with another strategyif this one turns out to be a total whitewash .
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices when they are awake which others do not hear or see .
Not only in the mentally sick and during intoxication with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become blurred .
As long as this happens in sleep , things are fine .
When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed , we can surrender to the wildest imaginations and fantasies without restraint .
But anybody experiencing dream-like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake , is regarded in contemporary Western society as a madman or drug addict , or strange at the very least .
But such images and voices are formed not only in the mentally sick or during drug intoxication .
This is down to our imagination : The same neural processes which allow us to design houses , draw paintings or write novels can make the borders between dream , madness and reality become blurred .
Conscious conditions which are warped like dreams can occur in the most different forms , in the best case we call them visions , in the worst case madness .
Even if their triggers and effects may differ , the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen , the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda , shaman detachment from reality conditions , psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes .
Hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline , serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional .
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychoses .
Gravity no longer has any power over him
The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times .
Aristotle understood hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake , Wilhelm Griesinger , a founder of modern psychiatry , detected in 1861 a " huge similarity of madness and dreamlike conditions , " for Sigmund Freud dreams were even " a psychosis , with all puzzles , delusions and misperceptions of such . "
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure .
His body is two-dimensional and excessively gaudy .
Gravity no longer has any power over him , he floats at the ceiling of the room .
He feels a kick .
Behind him are winged devilish figures with red , distorted faces , snarling .
They hunt him , kick him with heavy , flaming boots , throw him against walls , he feels the pain all over his body .
Loud , evil voices emerge from the walls and radio .
He can no longer stand them , the voices that abuse and insult him .
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system , ties them to a knot and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling .
He climbs on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck .
He jumps .
The noose becomes loose .
Let that be a lesson to you , the voices scream in an eardrum-tearing choir , " go to the clinic and get treated ! "
Today , Henning T. is 40 years old , he has had six acute psychoses , the last one is two years back , the first nearly 20 years ago .
It was caused by LSD .
His diagnosis is a schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis , he is also a manic-depressive , he takes drugs against depression , the mania and schizophrenia .
He has learned to live with his illness , he has been married for three years .
In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest desperation , he says .
The illusions are a brutal reality
About 1 per cent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia ; in psychiatric clinics , it is treated with a frequency only second to depression .
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis , people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external world , they reach an overexcited condition which can result in hallucinations , megalomania , paranoia or persecution mania .
Particularly common is the hearing of voices - voices which command , comment or involve in dialogue .
Visual hallucinations are also not rare .
The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from unimportant things , the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals , the conscious is flooded by impressions .
Like dreams , a psychosis also opens the floodgates on a flood of ideas and phantasies , which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious .
The perception of reality in a psychosis is subject-centred , says professor Thomas Fuchs , senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic of Heidelberg .
Schizophrenic patients are at the heart of the events , the meaning of everything is directed to him .
At the same time , he finds himself in a passive role , he is , like in a dream , overwhelmed by the events can cannot affect them actively .
Schizophrenic patients therefore often feel threatened , controlled and manipulated .
A reality comparison is often not available to them , the illusions are a brutal reality , waking up is not possible .
To experience a hallucination once in your life
Contrary to dreams , says Fuchs , " the sensual and spatial structure of reality , as perceived during a psychosis , remains intact as a rule . "
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality , the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality .
Precisely why our brain plays such tricks on us , is still puzzling to scientists .
Extraordinary conditions can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time , says Fuchs .
But not everybody will develop a psychosis .
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia , but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the sole factor .
Scientists assume that patients have minimal brain damage .
We think that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development , through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy , for instance , explains Fuchs .
But it remains a mystery how disturbances to the neuronal system comes about which also do not become manifest for many years initially .
Environmental impacts also play a part - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychoses if the disposition is given .
Hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychoses , as they interfere with the transmitter system .
When our brain runs hot
The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them , others spend money on drugs to get the same , says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten .
Whether these illusions are perceived to be pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of perspective .
Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions ; last year he assessed his results in a book titled The unreal World in our Head .
Hallucinations are a typical by-product of psychoses , but also of a remarkably large amount of other diseases .
These include , on top of mental illnesses such as borderline or depression , also often diseases such as migraine , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer 's disease and traumatic brain injuries .
Surprisingly , even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under certain conditions .
Hallucinations , says Kasten , consist of memory fragments , which are often held back .
They occur when areas of the brain , where sensory perceptions are processed , are overactive or not sufficiently restrained ; when our brain runs hot and also when there is a lack of stimulation .
Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psychosis .
But sensory deprivation , stress , lovesickness or other mental exceptional conditions too .
In more recent studies , up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives .
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old , she is living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school .
Indeed , a perfectly normal girl .
It it were not for the images and voices .
During breaks , it can happen that a lanky boy with long dark hair approaches her .
When she answers him , her schoolmates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy .
They think the girls is a nutty daydreamer , but Sarah K. is not dreaming , she knows that much .
She is awake , she sees and hears this boy , just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her .
She can even feel his presence , at least for some moments .
A pleasant feeling it is , she likes the boy .
Am I mad ? she sometimes asks .
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again .
At night the appearances are usually frightening
The illusions are often a strain .
When she is sitting in the classroom , she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new schoolmate , while she is explaining mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else .
At night the appearances are usually frightening .
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room , which comes far too rarely and late , she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming , whether the images she sees , the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes .
Let me be , she screams at the figures .
She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this , they would think she was mad .
Autumn 2009 . Sarah K. is 20 years old now .
She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boyfriend .
A year ago the hallucinations stopped .
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten via the internet , she knows exactly that she is not mad .
Madness is also work of art born out of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from sensory deprivation , he will very probably suffer from hallucinations after some time , says Kasten .
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment .
Sarah K. , a single child , was afraid of other children when she was small ; she often played alone .
Her hallucinations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father .
As during visual and acoustic hallucinations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impressions and sounds , it is often difficult for patients like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality . " Every experience , " says Kasten , " takes place in the brain , reality is reproduced there .
Hallucinations are also images , which the brain creates , this is why they seem so real . "
Illusions at night are also classified by Kasten as a form of hallucination .
The hallucinations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psychosis .
Contrary to schizophrene patients , mentally healthy people are able to identify illusions as unreal .
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability .
Border between dream and hallucination
In our far too conscious-centred world , imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised , says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard , professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf .
A psychosis is a severe , painful illness , but it also brings positive aspects , creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation .
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience , a particular form of conscious conditions which are warped like dreams .
Oneiroids are highly complex , detailed quasi dreams , which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being awake .
The oneiroid condition occurs in trauma- or sickness-related extreme situations , for instance in polyradiculitis patients , who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness .
If a person is threatened by self- or world loss , for instance due to persistent , complete loss of mobility , he replaces the life-threatening real situation with an own , imaginary world , which is uncoupled from reality , says Schmidt-Degenhard .
A kind of border between dream and hallucination
As the mastering of a situation is not possible in reality , a change of world takes place , but the real situation is not updated in the imagination .
An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbearable situation , which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emptiness of a loss of consciousness .
Everything is real , even later in the memory
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole 's attempt to safe itself .
He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit .
Claussen delves into a world of his creation , visits foreign places and times : He experiences himself as a bedridden , old man , on board a train sanatorium , a robot watching over his health .
He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst noblemen who make intoxicants from blood .
He is abducted by a Greek man on his motorbike to his homeland , surfs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the mafia .
He is fully taken up with the imaginary events ; everything is real , even later in his memory .
These inner trips , Claussen believes , are fundamentally different from every dream .
Dream is a different condition , he describes his experience .
Contrary to that , the memories from mental trips are overtly clear to me even after years and in minute detail .
Even clearer and more intense that real events .
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our day-to-day experiences , says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard .
Ultimately , oneiroids , psychoses , hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our images of the external reality are , even when awake .
Every change to the conscious , summarises psychologist Kasten , " can result in a warping of what we call reality . "
An experience which can indeed be enriching .
Taxpayers meet mortgage on Tory 's £ 75,000 orangery
Alan Duncan , the frontbench Tory MP , charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year towards the cost of an orangery he built at his constituency home .
The party 's prisons spokesman , who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living " on rations , " increased his mortgage by £ 75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland .
He was allowed to charge the extra interest , totalling hundreds of pounds a month , to the taxpayer .
The Commons authorities approved the claims at the time and they have not been queried by Sir Thomas Legg , who is conducting a review of members " expenses . Last night Mr Duncan said the claims " couldn 't be cleaner or simpler . "
Mr Duncan , one of the richest Members of Parliament , owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency .
Houses near by have sold for almost a million pounds .
The ground floor comprises a kitchen , living room and dining room , but the fees office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space .
Last year he added a conservatory to the house , described in plans as an " orangery . "
Neighbours described it as a " glasshouse for entertaining . "
Mr Duncan was not required to make any reference to the increased borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons " Standards and Privileges Committee into his previous mortgage arangements .
The committee cleared him last month of breaching the rules after an investigation into his expenses .
In 2004 Mr Duncan changed the legal security for a £ 271,406 mortgage from his London property to his constituency home , which he had bought in 1991 , the year before he became an MP .
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming about £ 1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year .
In April , his claims increased to more than £ 1,800 a month .
The interest rate on Mr Duncan 's RBS mortgage did not change in that time , suggesting that all the increase was to fund the £ 75,000 borrowing .
The RBS standard variable mortgage rate went down from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year , where it remains .
The latest document release by the Commons authorities show that Mr Duncan was continuing to claim £ 1,250 a month this May .
Mr Duncan lost his job as Shadow Leader of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive " on rations " after the expenses scandal .
" Basically , it 's being nationalised , you have to live on rations and are treated like s * * t . "
He said : " I spend my money on my garden and claim a tiny fraction based on what is proper .
And I could claim the whole bloody lot , but I don 't . "
The MP , a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader , was first challenged over his expenses in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden , before agreeing with the fees office that this " could be considered excessive . "
An activist dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Mr Duncan 's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £ 4,000 over three years .
Asked about the increased mortgage last night , Mr Duncan said : " It was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and subsequently by Legg . "
He added : " There is no issue of ducking and weaving or pushing the rules or anything .
It is absolutely straight down the line , within the rules , authorised and everything .
It just couldn 't in many ways be cleaner or simpler . "
U.N. group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the next 40 years , with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term .
The text , which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases , highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illuminated a path forward .
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time , with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week .
Forged by a U.N. ad-hoc working group , the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term .
And it provides a range of options for the key questions , including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output , and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate .
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process , said John Coequyt , senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club .
Michael Zammit Cutajar , who drafted the six-page document , boiled down a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the U.N. ' s top climate official , Yvo de Boer , described as " the big picture . "
It shows the outlines for a possible deal , in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels , while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent .
Together , the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050 .
The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $ 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation .
Still , Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week .
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world .
The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago .
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action , said Stern , who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers .
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei said America 's top climate negotiator was either lacking " common sense " or being " extremely irresponsible " for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming .
With the future economic trajectory of the world 's major powers at stake , fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies .
The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet , with China and the United States feuding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world 's two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action .
Ricardo Ulate , a Costa Rican delegate , said it 's not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases , even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions .
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed , said Ulate , who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change adviser for Conservation International .
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen , although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best .
The Alliance of Small Island States , which has 43 members , produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning .
Artur Runge-Metzger , who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission , said the push by small island nations has " put political pressure on the entire political process , " in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India .
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal .
High-level officials such as Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister stepped off planes and raced through the Bella Center 's halls to closed-door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitrated over the next week .
The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .
The intensity is only building : nearly all of the key ministers are now here , and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen .
We 're getting into the big leagues , said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez , vice president for global policy at Conservation International .
The heavyweights are coming .
In aging China , a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them that " Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children " and " One more baby means one more tomb . "
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials , alarmed by their city 's low birthrate and aging population , abruptly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child , their reaction was instant and firm : No way .
We have already given all our time and energy for just one child .
We have none left for a second , said Wang , 31 , a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son .
More than 30 years after China 's one-child policy was introduced , creating two generations of notoriously chubby , spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed " little emperors , " a population crisis is looming in the country .
The average birthrate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect , according to the U.N.
Population Division , while the number of residents 60 and older is predicted to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050 . That is far above the global average of about 20 percent .
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations , such as Shanghai .
Last year , people 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai 's registered residents , while the birthrate was less than one child per couple .
Xie Lingli , director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission , has said that fertile couples need to have babies to " help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future . "
Shanghai is about to be " as old -- not as rich , though -- as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden , " she said .
A gradual easing
Written into the country 's constitution in 1978 , China 's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date .
Couples who violate the policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work .
Chinese officials have credited the policy with helping the country avoid critical strain on its natural resources , while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy .
In rural areas , some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions .
In addition , many couples have had sex-selective abortions , leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio .
In recent years , population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy .
In 2004 , they allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents , members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children -- and in 2007 , they toned down many of their hard-line slogans .
Qiao Xiaochun , a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University , said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes , such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child .
In July , Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births .
Almost overnight , posters directing families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit .
The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors .
It has also pledged to provide emotional and financial counseling to those electing to have more than one child .
The response has been underwhelming , family planning officials say .
Disappointing response
Although officials in one rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched , the more urban districts report no change .
Huinan township , with a population of 115,000 , for instance , is still receiving just four to five applications a month .
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that , despite the campaign , the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008 .
Feng Juying , head of the family planning committee in Shanghai 's Caolu township , said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don 't want more children .
They want to give the best to their first , she said .
Yang Jiawei , 27 , and his wife , Liu Juanjuan , 26 , said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so .
But like many Chinese , they have only the scant medical and life insurance provided by the government .
Without a social safety net , they say , the choice would be irresponsible .
People in the West wrongly see the one-child policy as a rights issue , said Yang , a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple 's first child .
Yes , we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child .
But the problem is not just some policy .
It is money .
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitating .
Wang , the human resources administrator , said she wants an only child because she was one herself : " We were at the center of our families and used to everyone taking care of us .
We are not used to taking care of and don 't really want to take care of others . "
Chen Zijian , a 42-year-old who owns a translation company , put it more bluntly .
For the dual-career , middle-class parents who are bringing the birthrate down , he said , it 's about being successful enough to be selfish .
Today 's 20- and 30-somethings grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China 's experiment with capitalism and don 't want that kind of life for themselves , he said .
Even one child makes huge demands on parents ' time , he said .
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life .
Then there are the space issues -- " You have to remodel your apartment " -- and the strategizing -- " You have to have a résumé ready by the time the child is 9 months old for the best preschools . "
Most of his friends are willing to deal with this once , Chen said , but not twice .
Ours is the first generation with higher living standards , he said .
We do not want to make too many sacrifices .
Gates : Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose " significant additional sanctions " on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions .
Gates , speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic .
There are no good options in Iran , he said , in response to a query from a soldier about the likelihood of such a development . ¨
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years , [ it ] is the inherent unpredictability of war .
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran 's military and political elite , but Gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians .
He said that " a package of incentives and disincentives " would be needed " to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons " because " their people will suffer enormously " from sanctions .
In a statement Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face " credible " consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes .
In talks in Geneva on Oct . 1 , it indicated that it would return to talks on restraining its nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor .
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations .
But since then , Iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part , experts say , because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States .
Frankly , Iran 's stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October , I think , has brought the international community , including the Russians and the Chinese , together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iranians , Gates said .
President Obama has set a Dec . 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he turns to reviewing other options , including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called " crippling sanctions . "
In a statement issued in New York , Iran 's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called " baseless and unfounded allegations " Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran 's nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers " in order to achieve an appropriate , long-term solution . "
Gates , who was to return to Washington late Friday , met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to Iraq 's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil .
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq 's Arab majority , particularly over boundaries , property rights and revenue-sharing .
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in U.S. plans to cut the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August .
Gates also sought to allay Kurdish anxiety about the pending drawdown . U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani , president of the Kurdistan Regional Government : " We will preserve your security , prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq .
We will not abandon you . "
Making higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud wheeze .
Graciela Rodriguez , 12 , stepped off and blinked for a moment at the white columns , brick facades and emerald lawns .
Graciela 's parents had barely graduated from high school in El Salvador .
Until recently , Graciela herself , who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale , had never set foot on a college campus .
Yet as she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg , where the tuition runs $ 38,690 a year , their attitude was less that of awestruck visitors than of enthusiastic prospective students .
Yes ! This is where I 'll be ! exclaimed Graciela , who would like to study medicine , when the guide announced that they 'd entered the science building .
Wow , really ? she said thoughtfully , when told of the school 's low professor-to-student ratio .
The Pennsylvania college was the seventh the kids had visited on their three-day tour , and by now they had completely absorbed its intended message : The question is not whether you 're going to college .
The question is where .
Although there is mounting concern about the large number U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregnant as teenagers , there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educations they need to enter the middle class .
In fact , one in five of these " second-generation " Hispanics graduates from college -- a notable achievement given that so many of their immigrant parents , mostly Mexicans and Central Americans , entered the United States without finishing high school .
Their success stories are important , researchers say , because they point the way forward for a generation that will play an outsize role in the country 's workforce .
Those who study high achievers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed .
Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools .
But mentoring programs also can play an enormous role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her make it to college -- particularly if those efforts are sustained over time .
When you 're looking at low-income kids whose parents don 't have the experience and the skills to help them navigate through the system , any single intervention at any one point in time is not going to solve it , said Patricia Gándara , a researcher at the University of California , Davis , who has studied Latino students .
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these kids from preschool all the way on through high school .
The federal program that funded Graciela 's college tour is a useful example .
Known as GEAR UP , it provides more than $ 300 million a year to local school systems to run college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school .
Since 1999 , the program has served more than 10 million students , with more than 60 percent going on to college , according to the U.S. Department of Education .
Pakistani officials unraveling plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops , saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men .
Investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure known as Saifullah , who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube .
Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan , attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan 's tribal belt that is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps .
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network .
As a result , they were marooned for days in the eastern city of Sargodha , far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a terrorist haven .
They were regarded as a sting operation .
That 's why they were rejected , said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case .
The official said the men were undeterred and were still trying to acquire the right endorsements to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement .
The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and , perhaps more importantly , determining who can be trusted .
Since the Sept . 11 , 2001 , attacks , U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-Qaeda .
The organization 's recruiters act as gatekeepers , keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to holy war , and those who could be spies .
Would-be American recruits are treated by al-Qaeda with special scrutiny , analysts said .
But they are also considered enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value .
But Evan Kohlmann , senior analyst with the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation , said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruiting methods .
If you 're trying to sink someone into these groups , what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed ? Kohlmann said .
The model is one that has become far more Web-based .
ADB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called for India and China to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that will stunt the growth of Asian economies .
Rajat Nag , the managing director of the Manila-based ADB , said the world 's two fastest-growing large economies had to " do all they can " to speed the recovery of the the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral arrangements .
He warned against Bric [ Brazil , Russia , India , China ] countries looking at Europe 's difficulties in a " dispassionate way " and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term breakdown in the global economy .
" We are all in this together . "
" So anybody who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful , " he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai .
" Asia may be shielded to some extent but it cannot be immune . "
" So if China and India can help , by all means . "
Europe 's monetary union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months .
In recent days , Italy 's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned .
The unfolding sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and prompted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution .
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF , but said bilateral assistance -- like buying the bonds of the EU 's bail-out fund , the European financial stability facility -- offered greater bargaining power to Europe 's Asian partners .
Anand Sharma , India 's minister of trade , said that " India will do whatever it can " to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering falling exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows .
" Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent , " he said .
" We have monumental challenges and we have to sustain a high level of growth . "
" It is not an option , it is an imperative , because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women . "
Others argue that developing economies like India have no business helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges .
Ashutosh Varshney , a professor at Brown University in the US , said it would be politically very difficult to sell assistance to Europe to India 's 1.2bn people , of whom as many as 800m live on about $ 2 a day or less .
" Sometime they will find out that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to beaches and it won 't go down well , " he said .
Lee Howell , the managing director of the World Economic Forum , likewise questioned why India 's reserves should be used to keep Greece 's numerous and well-paid public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed , loss-making utilities like the railways .
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened " significant knock-on effects " across Asia .
The ADB 's forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011 / 12 now faced " risks on the downside " because of the threat from Europe .
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies .
Dire warnings from Pentagon over potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta turned up the heat on Congress Monday , warning that looming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the hallways of the Pentagon , to the battlefields of Afghanistan , to civilian assembly lines .
The Pentagon already is digesting $ 450 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional $ 600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending .
" The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department , " Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain , R-Arizona , and Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina .
He said that congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger 23 % across-the-board reductions and a halt to many new projects .
" Such a large cut , applied in this indiscriminate manner , would render most of our ship and construction projects unexecutable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other modernization efforts , " Panetta wrote to the senators .
" We would also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel involuntarily and , because the reduction would be imposed so quickly , we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians in order to meet the target . "
" These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness . "
The cuts would eventually hit combat troops , Panetta said .
" While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequester , war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the base budgets , " Panetta warned .
" Contracting personnel would be cut , resulting in delays in the contracts and the contract oversight that support the war . "
" Payroll personnel would be cut , resulting in late payments to wartime vendors , and legal and policy support would be disrupted . "
The two senators had written Panetta 10 days ago , asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department .
" The consequence of a sequester on the Defense Department would set off a swift decline of the United States as the world 's leading military power . "
" We are staunchly opposed to this draconian action , " the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta 's letter .
" This is not an outcome that we can live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves . "
" The sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States , and it should not be allowed to occur . "
Whether the Panetta letter and the fresh warnings from Senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen .
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts , although he came to the top Pentagon job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices .
At a news conference last week , the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no core .
" It 's a ship without sailors . "
" It 's a brigade without bullets . "
" It 's an air wing without enough trained pilots . "
" It 's a paper tiger , an Army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon .
" It 's a force that suffers low morale , poor readiness and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries . "
" In effect , it invites aggression .. "
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham , Panetta spelled out new specifics of how reductions " generate significant operational risks : delay response time to crises , conflicts , and disasters ; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world ; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations . "
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning .
That list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter , a planned new bomber , the next-generation ballistic submarine , the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Marines need to replace the humvee .
Halting further development and testing the F35 could generate some $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years but its supporters say it is a vital next step to upgrade and meet potential threats from China and other rivals .
How to spot a lie
A glance at recent headlines indicates just how serious and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life .
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading allegations of sexual harassment with several women ; each side accuses the other of lying .
Administrators at Penn State have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys .
Last week French president Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open microphone asserting to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar .
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries .
New York congressman and Internet flasher Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence .
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover-up of an extramarital affair .
And then again , no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky .
Tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife .
There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews .
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable .
How much deceit do we encounter ?
On a given day , studies show , you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
Now granted , many of those are white lies .
Another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
Detecting lies , or " lie spotting , " is an essential skill for everyone to acquire , for both personal and professional reasons .
Far from being a parlor game similar to , say , charades , where the object is to exclaim , " Gotcha , " deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in-depth research projects , especially in psychology and physiology .
One result of the research is that most old myths about lying have been debunked .
Liars do look you in the eye .
They do not always stutter , stammer , blush or fidget .
Don 't conclude from this that liars are hard to spot and difficult to unmask .
A trained lie spotter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure , facial micro-expressions , question formation and timing .
I spent several years surveying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception , and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring , interviewing , negotiating or managing .
Good liars are skilled at reading others well , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them .
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts , that men tell more " self-oriented " lies while women tell more " other-oriented " lies -- usually to protect someone 's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be " whoppers " ) .
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer , others will feel less guilt in lying to you .
How do you tell if someone is lying ?
First , observe your subject 's normal behavior .
This is called " baselining . "
It helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later .
Observe your subject 's posture , laugh , vocal quality .
You 'd better know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you don 't make unjust accusations when you see foot-tapping in the middle of the meeting .
Then look for clusters of deceptive verbal and nonverbal behaviors .
Consider these clusters red flags , not proof of deception .
Deceptive people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , lean toward an exit , shift their posture in significant ways or exhibit " post-interview relief " -- that exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over .
Interrogators often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post-interview relief .
Also , pay attention to your subject 's language .
Scott Peterson famously slipped and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive , launching a nationwide search for her .
Deceptive individuals might also use distancing language : " I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky " or repeat a hard question in its entirety .
The most common verbal indicators are subtle .
Someone might use lots of " qualifying language " when answering a hard question : " Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge . "
This renders the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag .
There 's no magic bullet for detecting lies , but developing skills to ferret out deception is possible .
These skills will enhance anyone 's chances of avoiding victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal lives .
The North Stream , a new portal for the entry of Russian gas into Europe
The North Stream gasduct connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea , has been commissioned .
It is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes .
Gazprom , the giant Russian gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a " bang . "
Over 500 guests including four heads of State and of government took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic , between an orchestral performance and a fine buffet , in the inauguration of North Stream , the new gasduct , which directly links Russia and Germany under the sea .
Symbolically , the German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev , the French prime minister François Fillon and his Dutch opposite number Mark Rutte jointly turned the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network .
With this new gasduct , 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe via a first pipeline of 1 224 km linking the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania .
A second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 , making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire French consumption .
And the possibility of constructing a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .
For Gazprom , the completion on time of this huge project is a victory .
The project was fiercely competed for by Poland and the Baltic States .
The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany , avoiding any passage via a third country ( Poland or the Ukraine ) .
These two countries will lose some of their power : it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets .
At the most critical point of the debate , Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new " German-Soviet pact , " referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939 .
That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive .
By supporting this Russian project , Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies .
But at the price of depriving Europe of energy , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe .
Russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries , which consume large quantities of gas , and whose deposits are declining .
" This gasduct is a component of partnership with Russia , it is a new artery which links us organically , " confirmed François Fillon inaugurating the gasduct , demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important .
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom , present in large numbers at Lubmin , the point of arrival of the gas .
The construction of this gasduct is also a technical exploit .
The undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships ' anchors .
Ir rests on the bottom of the sea , at an average depth of 200 metres .
To construct it , it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the second World War .
" A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution , " says Jens Müller , spokesman of North Stream company .
It was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora .
The pipeline is a long metal serpent , of weight equivalent to that of 242 Eiffel towers , with no breaks throughout its length , no valves and no maintenance stations .
A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden , but the project managers abandoned it since the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores .
" In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute , " states Jens Müller .
In the case of a leak , the gas contained in the gasduct therefore escapes into the air .
But this is thought to be unlikely by the constructors who provided welds to leak only every 100 000 years .
The surveillance of the state of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot , pulled by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct .
Being cigar-shaped , it is introduced inside the 1-metre wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .
On arrival after 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second , it delivers precise information concerning any metal deformation .
The gasduct was designed to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair .
The gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure .
This is 200 bar on leaving and 100 bar on arrival .
Five companies combined their forces to implement this project .
The leader remains Gazprom , which holds 51 % of the shareholding .
The others are the German companies E.ON and BASF ( 15.5 % each ) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez ( 9 % each ) .
These five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream , delegated to construct and to operate the gasduct .
It has its headquarters at Zug in Switzerland , where taxation is particularly favourable .
Gazprom next leased to this company for twenty renewable years , the entire capacity of gas transport .
" Gazprom will pay for the total capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , " states Jens Müller .
The financing of the construction of the gasduct was provided to the extent of 30 % by the shareholders and of 70 % by Bank loans .
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million Euros for the two pipelines .
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 millions .
But the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs , since Gazprom assumes the entire risk .
The gasduct emerges from the Baltic sea at Lubmin on a sandy littoral planted with conifers .
4.5 metre high valves form the gas exit .
Sensors measure pressure , temperature and the specific gravities of arriving gas before being transferred into German gasducts .
Since last Tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour .
At full capacity , this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012 , 6 million .
General Meeting Should Find a President , Mate Threat Returns
For nearly five months , Czech football has had no President . There exists a risk that Ivan Hašek 's successor , the head of Czech Republic 's Football Association ( FAČR ) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting , which is to take place in Nymburk on Thursday .
There is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow .
Without it , voting for the three candidates will not start .
Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta , and Tomáš Paclík are eager to lead Czech football .
Hašek resigned from his function in June . When leaving , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future .
However , Hašek 's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers , unable to agree on a common candidate .
This was fully shown on September 16 , when a new President was to be chosen .
General meeting delegates wasted their trip to the National House in Prague , Smíchov , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .
No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only , or also officials given power of attorney .
This single point has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law , according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible .
Arguments concerning the election rules continue , though .
The Executive Board has not been of much help either , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , it is mostly preoccupied by this issue .
The view of election options has changed several times , but the key point remains the same .
The question is : How to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid mate ?
" The argument is based on whether to follow the by-laws or to find another model , " says one of the three FAČR Vice-Presidents , Dušan Svoboda , who represents professional football in the association 's management .
Based on the model given by the by-laws , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .
Moravia is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election .
The Czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total , the winner must gain at least two-third superiority .
" However , the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning ; that would completely deny the two-chamber concept , " Svoboda agrees with Moravia 's arguments . He says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations .
Somewhat surprisingly Tomáš Paclík agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by-laws fits Pelta best of the candidates .
' I wish the elections follow the by-laws to the maximum . '
" I want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense , as at the previous general meeting , " says the owner of Viktorie Plzeň , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chiefly stood against Pelta .
Pelta remains an optimist .
He believes the new President will be known in Nymburk ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate constructively .
" All passionate stirring will calm down with today 's prospective advance of the national team into the European Championship . "
" Football will be back on the happy wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , " a Jablonec functionary says . Of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .
Rajchl is more reserved .
" I hope for an agreement , but the situation is very ambivalent . "
" It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia , but there are attempts at purposeful adjustment of regulations . "
" That may cause another blockage of the general meeting . "
" I hope the common sense wins , " Rajchl said .
There is not much time left for an agreement between the parties .
Some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro ; but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match .
An extra flight that was to take , among others , the Vice Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure . An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch .
Finally , a meeting at ministry level , said to happen on Wednesday , may decide .
Minister of Education , Youth , and Sports , Josef Dobeš , would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement .
A lot is in the game : Government grants ; football trustworthiness ; and the planned ČSTV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following Sazka 's financial problems .
Paclík Enters the Presidential Fight As He Cannot See a Suitable Candidate
If , before the extraordinary general meeting , the Head of Pilsen football players , Tomáš Paclík , saw a strong candidate , who would meet all of his expectations of a new Football Association of the Czech Republic ( FAČR ) President , he would not even apply for the top function .
" If there was a good quality candidate , I 'd fight for him and not participate in the fight . "
" But no such person has currently been found , " Paclík said to ČTK .
Paclík 's motivation to join the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to try to prevent Pelta , reportedly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the FAČR .
Moreover , Paclík emphasizes that should he win , he would only remain the President until 2013 , when a regular general meeting is scheduled .
In the future , he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager , not excessively connected to football life .
" I 've spoken to some people that could be considered . "
" I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point , they don 't even want to identify themselves with Czech football . "
" I 'd like to change this opinion , " he said .
At the moment , Paclík 's strongest disagreement with Pelta is based on the latter 's connection to Roman Berbr , President of Pilsen 's regional football association . Berber is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as powerful lobbyist , capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates .
Paclík therefore finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become the President .
" If he wins , current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . "
" Combined with support from Berbr , a capable businessman , this would be even more harmful for the football , " Paclík said .
He is hinting at the fact that some years ago , Pelta 's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation ; Pelta came out without a sentence .
" I don 't know what prestige Pelta 's victory would bring to football . "
" And how would we look in the eyes UEFA and FIFA , " Paclík said . He is now more detached from his former statement saying he would " sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became President . "
In case Paclík wins on Thursday , he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future .
This opinion is shared by another candidate , Rajchl , whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fiasco .
" He ( Pelta ) would be the first one I 'd go to . "
' He is very capable . '
" I can see him as the head of the representation . "
' But he cannot manage the association . '
" I don 't poke my nose in what I don 't understand either , ' said Paclík , who gained a lot of attention in September , when he supported the removal of board of referees , led by Luděk Macela , replaced by Dagmar Damková .
Paclík claims he would dare to manage the association .
He refers to his skills from management of private companies ; since last summer , he has been managing the Pilsen team that , with his support , celebrated its first league triumph in May .
" I have the strength to make the football environment change , to support its improvement . "
" To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board , leading to disgusting situations , " Paclík said . He does not hide his antipathy for , e.g. Sparta 's Director , Daniel Křetínský .
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax .
" That 's one of the key things the new President should attend to . "
" If taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties declare , I understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , " he said .
Paclík does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden , though he claims that an FAČR President should be a non-party one .
Pelta is connected to Jablonec , and Rajchl to Prague Dukla .
" It 's not ideal . "
" Yet , I don 't see a point in transferring my shares in the Pilsen club hypocritically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , " Paclík says .
Pelta Promised New FAČR Regulations That Would Avoid Election Mate
Two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the Presidential candidates , Miroslav Pelta , promised that if he is elected , he would strive for new FAČR regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules .
Before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk , a Jablonec functionary remains an optimist and believes that the pre-election fight would be significantly suppressed by today 's prospective success of our football representation .
Prior to the failed election in September , Pelta promised that if he was to win , he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means .
He decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment . A two-month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context .
" People at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the President to be known on Thursday . "
" They feel it 's high time someone leads the association , " claims the man chiefly connected with the Jablonec club ; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association 's executive board .
This gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage Czech football .
He believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of Ivan Hašek 's reign .
" Unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June . "
" If various representations were not accepted , we would have had a President since September , " Pelta said .
He approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates .
" If I become President , I will take it as my personal task , and I 'm willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails . "
" It is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without , " Pelta claims .
Other than that , he says he does not try to define himself against the rivals .
In the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl , whom he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice President .
For a long time , he did not attack Tomáš Paclík , who has constantly criticised Pelta .
" He 's been in football for over a year , and gained some success . "
" However , his attacks were not decent , and many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign . "
" This is too , is why some of them now doubt his true character , " Pelta said about his rival . Pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations he announced in September .
He sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football , from the lowest competitions to representation .
The representation should be the shopping window of football .
" Í would also try to end all affairs , starting from the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year 's corruption scandal . "
" Right after that , I would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors , to ensure enough money for the whole football , " the forty-six year old candidate told ČTK two months ago .
He then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel housecleaning .
" I 'd need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees . " That was his message for Strahov , where the long period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness .
Despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , he believes that on Thursday , the delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain .
" If the only questionable point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . "
" Football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader , " says Pelta , who , two days before the crucial day of his career of a functionary , remains an optimist .
Rajchl Promises That under Him , the FAČR Will Start Working Hard
If , on Thursday 's general meeting , Jindřich Rajchl , the existing Vice President , is to become the President of Czech Football Association , many people in the Association would reportedly not be pleased .
Rajchl promises that if he is elected , hard work will come .
He wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas .
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case ; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the previous President , Ivan Hašek .
" As President , I 'd like to focus on football as a whole . "
" From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth . "
" By this , I don 't mean I 'd do everything on my own , " Rajchl said in his interview for ČTK .
" I 'm a team player , and I want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area . "
' I 'll distribute tasks strictly so that in each of these segments , football makes big steps forward . "
" That would probably not please many people , as it would mean hard work , not just criticizing of the work of others , " he added .
Critical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidature .
" I 'm known to work 20 hours a day . "
" But I need to know if it has any sense ; and that I won 't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every move , " he explained his hesitation .
" However , many people told me I mustn 't give up , otherwise others would follow . "
" That 's a trust I can 't just throw away , " he said .
Moreover , he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hašek .
" A great amount of work was done in those two years , and I don 't want to throw it all away . "
" Processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and I don 't want someone else to stop them , " he said , in fear that if the other candidate , Miroslav Pelta , is elected , situation f the Association might return to the period before Hašek .
" I believe in systematic approach , which is something I don 't think Mirek Pelta is competent of . "
" He is chiefly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones . "
" I can be blamed for many things , but certainly not for being subjective . "
" I try to be objective . "
" I want to make football for everyone , because then everyone has a good time , not just the chosen few , " Rajchl said .
Furthermore , he refutes the allegations he would only be a Czech President .
" Though some people try to claim the opposite , I plan to do the maximum for Moravia . "
" For example , it is high time to consider about splitting the second league into Czech and Moravian parts , winners of which would continue into the first league . "
" This would prevent the current situation , where there are just three Moravian units in the league , which is a problem concerning young players in Moravia , " Rajchl said .
As the Presidential fight has been joined by Pilsen club Manager , Tomáš Paclík , Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win .
" Nevertheless , I can still feel a strong support in the Czech chamber that elected me its Vice President , and can see I have achieved some clear successes , " Rajchl said . Among his successes , he includes the saving of dozens of millions of Crowns on disadvantageous contracts , negotiating TV contracts , and negotiations about the lottery law .
On the other hand , he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault .
While claiming that Pelta has been ' disqualified from returning trustworthiness to Czech football ' , he considers the other rival , Paclík , a strong candidate that has things to offer .
" No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year . "
" If he is elected , I hope he would continue in the things Ivan Hašek started , without significant personnel changes in the committees . "
" He wouldn 't want to twist things for his own benefit , " Rajchl said about his rival .
Assists of Jágr and Voráček Helped Philadelphia 's Victory
During Monday 's NHL match , hockey forward , Jaromír Jágr 's two assists helped Philadelphia 's victory 5 : 3 on Carolina 's ice . Again , he leads the productivity of Czech players in the game .
In both cases , Claude Giroux , used the experience of a thirty-nine year old star ; he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match .
Two assists in the match also belonged to Jágr 's team-mate , Jakub Voráček .
After the match , Jágr told the overseas journalists he had predicted a great evening for Giroux .
" I told him before the match he would score a hat-trick . "
" I felt it . "
" You sometimes feel such things , " explained Jágr , after whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first Flyers " shot .
A little bit later , second score for the team bore Czech traces too .
The trailing Hurricanes ' Voráček won the puck and presented it to Maxim Talbot , who scored between the circles .
A second before the first break , a home player , Patrick Dwyer , narrowed the lead in a power-play , but the beginning of the second part was led by Flyers again .
Specifically by Giroux .
After assist with Jágr , he scored the third goal ; consequently , his shot was touched into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds .
" I love playing with him . "
" I don 't ; want to say he 's the best league player , but he 's definitely among the best three , " said Jágr , complimenting his center .
" I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him . "
" It makes me happy . "
" I want to assist him . "
" All those years in NHL , my team-mates tried to assist me , and now its reversing , " Jágr added .
Carolina made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer 's goal from a penalty shot , making it a single goal difference .
Further complications were avoided by Matt Read who increased the difference to two points .
" Pronger did great in our zone . "
" He poked out the puck , I gained speed , and Read went on to the more distant pole . "
" I aimed at him , and I 'm glad it worked , " Voráček described his view of the last goal of the match .
Its victory moved Philadelphia onto the top of the Eastern Conference .
Czech Montreal defenseman , Jaroslav Špaček , did not finish the match with Buffalo ; he left in the second period due to an upper body injury .
Along with the experienced back , the Candiens lost their two-goal lead and lost 2 : 3 after a penalty shoot-out .
Tomáš Plekanec failed to score on one of their raids .
More than lost points , the home trainer was sorry for high sick rate in the back , as the match was finished with just five defenders .
" The situation is bad . "
" We finished the match with just one experienced player , the rest were young men . "
" However , there is nothing we can do about that , we just have to face it , " Jacques Martin said .
" Substitution by substitution , it was overwhelming and we couldn 't resist . "
" We should have made the game simpler , moving the puck out of our zone . "
" That was our weakness , " a defender , P. K. Subban added .
With thirty interventions , Czech goalie , Ondřej Pavelec , helped Winnipeg 's 5 : 2 victory over Tampa Bay .
Jets " goals , which interrupted a five-match series of losses , were shared by five different scorers .
Brand Story :
The IMB Innovator Starts the Second Century of Its Existence
Should someone search for the word that would best express the IMB strategy , the closest one would probably be " long-term . "
To the wide public , IMB is a symbol of technological revolution ; the company is seen as a highly temporary one , yet it was founded over a hundred years ago .
The company 's durability goes back to its first boss , a visionary , Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think .
His motto : ' Think ! ' thus become an imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold ( as well as the name of its internal magazine that IMB started to publish in 1935 ) .
Moreover , it was the foundation of company culture Watson was building carefully .
" For us in IMB , long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future .
IMB survived and flourished for a hundred years , because it remained true to its original values , while it was not afraid to change everything around itself .
During our first century , this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .
In the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more , " says current company Director , Samuel J. Palmisano , on the occasion of the anniversary .
Sophisticated System
In the 1930s , Watson approached employee care similarly to Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IMB were among the first American employees to have a paid holiday , insurance from their employer , an elegant uniform , and a sophisticated system of bonuses for the best inventors and businessmen .
Just as sophisticated is IBM 's long-term relationship with customers .
From the very beginning , the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people . It was one of the first world companies to abolish all discrimination , which rendered it with great selection .
Consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman , Virginia Rometty , to take over after Palmisano next year .
She has been working in IMB for thirty years ; she is currently a Director of Sales , Marketing , and Strategy .
In the last few years , IMB has been organising jams , on-line brainstorming sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .
It is no surprise that the ideas are plentiful - the company employs nearly half a million people .
Institution with a Good Reputation
Company 's strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image .
" From the beginning , the concept of IBM was that of an institution rather than a technology company , ' a Harvard Business School Professor and author of a book about IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter , told the Economist .
" IBM is not a technology firm ; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology , " George Colony of Forrester Research consultation company adds .
As the company itself says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .
During the hundred years , IMB , or the " Big Blue , " as it is called in the US because of its logo , has grown into one of the largest companies in the world .
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting ; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies .
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies ; five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Price .
Its inventions include , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial swap , bar code , and floppy disc .
With about 220 billion dollars , based on market capitalisation , IBM has become the second largest technology company ( Apple being number one ) this year , overrunning Microsoft for the first time since 1996 .
View Ahead
Not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period . For example , IBM failed with its own operating system OS / 2 ; Prodigy on-line services ; and IBM PCjr computers .
" If your business is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emotionally attached to the past , ' says Samuel J. Palmisano .
That is why IBM easily builds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work , it leaves them .
This is how it differs from , for example , its competitor , Microsoft , which basically stands and falls on Windows , its operating system .
Perspective Technology
IBM 's revenues chiefly consist of services , about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware .
While in 1990 , with over a half share , it was the strongest hardware representative .
Since 2000 , IBM has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars . During the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .
It has continued the investments even after 2008 , when the modern economic crisis first hit the world .
IBM follows the legacy of its first director , Thomas J. Watson , who increased the amount of investments during the Great Depression .
So far , IMB seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm .
Since the beginning of 2008 , the price of IBM 's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent ; company 's net earnings have been growing continuously .
IBM 's company motto is to change everything , except for its values .
We may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes , this flexible giant will manage .
IBM History : From Cheese Cutter To Space Travel
IBM ( International Business Machines ) was founded in New York , a hundred years ago . Its original name " Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation " was quite complicated .
It took the name of IBM in 1924 . Originally , this was a brand used for company 's branches in Canada and South America .
Foundations for the later IBM were laid by a merger of four companies , the history of which goes back to the 1880s .
They owned technologies such as the legendary " time clock , " i.e. a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work .
The architect of the new company was a businessman , Charles Ranlett Flint , who , until 1930 , also presided over the company 's Board of Trustees .
Flint hired a director of a competing company , Thomas J. Watson , to help him with company management .
The leader then put the IBM 's founder in the shade - Watson 's ideas remain the base for invincible company culture and identity .
Watson led the company until 1952 .
IBM , as its name suggests , started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers .
During the first four years of Watson 's leadership , the revenue doubled to nine million dollars , and company 's vast expansion into all continents commenced .
Watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly forty years , his position in the director 's chair was taken by his son , Thomas Watson Junior .
Under his leadership , IBM started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language .
In 1960s , both people and computers from IBM helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury , Saturn , and in 1969 , man 's flight to the Moon .
Meanwhile , in 1964 , IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM line System / 360 .
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the period , called IBM 5150 , came to the market in 1981 .
Twenty years later , IBM sold computer production to a Chinese company , Lenovo , While buying the consultant division of PricewaterhouseCoopers , and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services .
In the past three years , IBM has been highly successful with its Smarter Planet concept .
Its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management .
For commerce , IBM has recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle .
IBM 's history is strong even in our country .
In former Czechoslovakia , as the first country in both Central and Eastern Europe , IBM founded its branch in 1932 .
Today , IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno .
The headquarters for both Central and Eastern Europe resides in Prague , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition .
What did the candidate of Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia ?
Analysis of the factors that affected Serna Melina Ramirez for not getting the crown of Miss Colombia .
The Valley gets its title number 14 of princess .
Once again Cauca Valley remains with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia .
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with being on the winning podium , wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia .
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena , where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter , the department counts with 14 Princess titles and Melina joins the legion of women of Valley of Cauca who have been close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses , among them Miriam Ospina Benoit ( 1947 ) , Clara Borrero Dominguez ( 1949 ) , Patricia Bellini Ayala ( 1979 ) , Lorena Álvarez ( 1981 ) , Rose Mary Alzate ( 1983 ) , Olga Maria Arenas ( 1987 ) , Leila Blanque ( 1988 ) , Monica Evers ( 1989 ) , Maria Consuela Pinedo ( 1990 ) , Diana Isabel Romero ( 1993 ) , Giselle Aljure Garcés ( 2000 ) , Catalina Giraldo ( 2007 ) , Stephanie Garcés Aljure ( 2008 ) .
Now the big question many are asking is :
What was missing ? Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia , not in vain she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue , titles that were obtained by queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro , who took the crown of Miss Colombia .
The first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question " ' What is the book that has marked you and why ? Asked ​ ​ by Martin Murillo Gomez from the Literary Cart Let 's read .
To the questioner she answered
" I read a lot , I believe a lot in literature , I think it is a form of culturalization , and I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is " The little Prince ' is a pretty deep book .
Today I read " Crime and Punishment ' it is a book of universal literature that we all should read ; and now I 'm reading the book by Irene Nemirovski , a Russian , a beautiful book called " The heat of blood . '
A response that the jury did not like due to the term " culturalization ' and second of all for not specifically explaining how each of the cited books have marked her .
But after the ceremony Melina said she was calm and happy with the result " the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen . "
And for you all , please read a little bit , ' The Little Prince ' it is a great book "
Among the launched hypotheses it is said that Valley got burned by favoritism .
A reporter from Bogota suggested that for being the preferred , the acclaimed , and the candidate who received all preliminary awards ( Oster food challenge , the public vote for the best traditional costume , and Mother Queen ) , " that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates , stressed the queen and therefore she did not shine on stage .
And that was noted in her first appearance in swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening coronation .
Although in both she looked confident , it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlántico representatives did show .
Ariel Osorio , a journalist of the program " Like home ' , of the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was designated as princess " means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the queen . "
In addition , Valley lately avoided talking to the press , and that was wrong .
Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work , which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest .
This is why , two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country .
" Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia , we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness , before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects , " she said .
There is also a speculation that Valley sinned for her defects on the posterior and the fibrosis that could be seen on her abdomen , but it is contradictory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate ' natural beauty ' with the healthier body , good nutrition and responsible physical work .
The coach of the queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body , that there were better , " but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen , which for me was not very noticeable , made her lose points the last day . "
Meanwhile , the journalist Guido Hoyos , of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valley of Cauca were the surgical interventions she suffered .
" The surgeries are fine , but Valley did not know how to do them .
Her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished .
For this award , which for the first time is given by the National Beauty Contest , after the swimsuit parade a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night , it was said that this was the flicker that Raymundo granted to Melina for not giving her the pleasure of taking the crown .
Reality or not , the fact is that Melina today begins a year of reign , not as sovereign , but as a princess , a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself .
However , she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena , found difficulties in getting the crown .
Such was the work of the person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali lophoscopist entered into history as the man who confirmed the death of " Alfonso Cano .
The work of these officials is a key work .
On November 4th the lophoscopist of Cali CTI passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC top leader , " Alfonso Cano , through the comparison of his fingerprints .
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the branch of CTI , this week it was the turn of " availability ' for Eleazar Gonzalez , a man of Puerto Tejada , who had spent 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation .
At the beginning of his career , Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó , where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be identified .
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and , after making the corresponding courses , he specialized in lophoscopy , which is the study of skin friction , meaning the palms of the hands and feet .
The week of Eliazar 's operation against alias Alfonso Cano he was warned to take clothes only for three days .
Something big was coming .
On Friday night he went from Cauca with a helicopter , to Palmira .
He knew he had to identify two corpses and one was suspected to be of the man who led the world 's oldest guerrilla , so they asked him to take the ten print card of Guillermo León Sáenz ( his real name ) .
However , when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was , he did not recognize him by his physical appearance ; it was very different from that seen in the media .
He was without beard , dressed as a farmer of the area , without glasses and much thinner .
But the prints do not lie .
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass , ink , a paddle and a flashlight , Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card .
His eye did not fail him : it was " Alfonso Cano ' .
That same night , the man from Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm the defense minister , Juan Carlos Pinzón , that it was the top leader of the FARC .
In search of the fingerprint
For a fingerprint specialist from Sijin of Cali the recognition made ​ ​ by the President Juan Manuel Santos to Eleazar Gonzalez in the press conference for the operation against " Cano ' , is very significant .
Many people do not know our work .
The fingerprinting science is an exact science , without error , which can be key solution in solving crimes .
Apart from the identification of bodies , the fingerprinting specialists support research for crimes like theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured .
When captured , many criminals have fake cards or do not have papers .
We will take their fingerprint and seek them in the database .
The researcher said that , in a case of theft , he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house because in that place the thief had supported his hand on to take a safe full of jewels and money .
" The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print , but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the offender , who had participated in several robberies " he said .
The prints can also rule out or confirm suspects in murder cases .
They have recently found a dead man , with liquor bottles around him .
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and , indeed , a print on the bottle matched .
Although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer , it places him it in the murder scene .
A fingerprint expert of CTI explained that in objects " footprints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents . "
When they appear there is used a paddle or tape to lift them .
After that , the prints are sent to Asif , which is the criminal database , or at the Registry .
" The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians , " said CTI expert .
He clarified that not everything is as shown in CSI television program .
Just as not everything that glitters is gold , not everything you touch turns into a footprint .
However , if it can be used , the comparison is being made .
The " angry persons " challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were crowding round in front of Zuccotti square to camp .
A part of the protesters listened to the eviction order and moved to a nearby park .
The members of the movement Occupy Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again , under the protection of a court order , in the Manhattan Square where they were evacuated at dawn when trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple .
Hundreds of protesters crowded round the Zuccotti square , where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order that allows " the angry persons " to camp on the site , while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park north the city where there have been made further arrests .
" Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square , we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti , and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations , " said one of the spokesmen of the movement " Occupy Wall Street , " Mark Bray .
Bray explained that the response of the " angry persons " to the evacuation of the camp issued personally by the mayor of New York , Michael Bloomberg , came to court , where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain camped .
In addition , the " angry persons " proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue , near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel , which connects New York and New Jersey , owned by the parish of Trinity Church .
At least for one hour they were able to occupy the place , but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters , although Bray could not confirm the precise number , while telling Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed .
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people camped at that point , where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to mediate with the police .
Meanwhile , Zuccotti square , which is a privately owned site , remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning .
Some of the protesters moved there were carrying and distributing at that time copies of that court order and even they gave these copies to officers guarding the place , which led to " some small confrontations , " said Bray , who claimed that some officers beaten the demonstrators .
The court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupy Wall Street and enforce " laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit demonstrators regain access to the park with shops and other property used before . "
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that , because of that court order , the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and protesters were informed , however , that local laws do not allow them to re-install with camping shops and sleeping bags .
The councilman personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti square carried out at dawn , an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and this was decided so because protesters were " violating the law . "
Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming " a place where people did not come to protest , but to break the law and , in some cases , to do harm to others " as " Some businesses had received threats ' and neighbors feared " for the quality of life . "
" The evacuation of this morning was disgusting and shows that deep inside Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers , " added the spokesman of the movement , who accused the mayor of " disrespect for the freedom of expression . "
The responsible of " Occupy Wall Street " also indicated that they intend to organize " great deeds " for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions , in order to commemorate the last two months of protests , which began on September 17th .
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome gives details of the crash where the Interior Minister , Francisco Blake , and seven others died .
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation ( MCT ) reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the Interior Secretary Francisco Blake Mora , and seven others died , indicate that the helicopter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity , without the pilot attempting a forced landing .
During a press conference , Dionisio Perez Jacome , Minister of Communications and Transport , said that before the aircraft took off , the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for the flight .
" The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the blades came into contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage . "
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people .
He also said that the investigations made ​ ​ in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground .
" In a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place , the impact is presented in a structural way .
" The design of the helicopter conceived for 19 passengers , fulfilled the appropriate requirements for transporting passengers .
The land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees .
For now , the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible ; however , the investigation may take several months or even one year .
Meanwhile , Gilberto Lopez Meyer , general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services , said that at the time of the impact , the Presidential helicopter was operating in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ascending land .
" This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact , " he said .
At the press conference , the owner of the SCT , Perez Jacome , listed six important elements in the investigation :
Visual flight :
According to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules , this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground .
Weather Conditions :
AICM reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clouds at low altitudes .
Selected routes :
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has searched an area of lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca .
Location of the impact .
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft radar match , probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction .
Dispersion of wreckage on a small area :
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line .
The dispersion of the wreckage suggests that the helicopter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity .
There was not detected evidence of fire or explosion :
On the area of the accident there remains undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the craft , some kind of explosion or fire .
Recent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground .
During the field work there have been found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9.200 feet above mean sea level , the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees .
The pictures show the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey .
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground .
After a thorough research in a wider area than the surrendered off area , near the place the accident took place , there have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft , which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity .
MSS announces a protocol for finding obesity gene
Social Security directs a research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people ; it is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute ( MSSI ) has announced that conducts a research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people , called the protocol of ' Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence ' , which will provide counting on markers associated with overweight .
In a statement , the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of Specialties Hospital , XXI Century National Medical Center , Miguel Cruz Lopez , explained that it was integrated a multidisciplinary team of physicians , nurses , nutritionists and social workers .
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health ( NIPH ) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies ( Cinvestav ) National Polytechnic Institute ( NPI ) .
The research invites the population entitled or not , to participate by going to the participant sport units of the MSSI in the Valley of Mexico , where there will be carried out the tests to children , every Saturday from 8 : 00 o 'clock .
He stressed that the protocol started in the Cuauhtémoc sports unit ( West Mexico State ) and since October 8th , the activity takes place in the Netzahualcoyotl Sport unit ( East State of Mexico ) .
Once reached the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children , the study will continue in the Independence Sport Unit ( South the Mexico City ) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit ( North the Mexico City ) .
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify in children and young Mexicans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases .
On November 14th , there will be celebrated the World Diabetes Day , and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years , with the consent and parental supervision for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food .
They will also be asked about physical activity and family hereditary history of disease , in order to avoid risk factors that give rise to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure .
He explained that on Saturday to all participants will be applied anthropometric measurements ( weight , height , and waist circumference ) , blood pressure measurements , and determination of glucose , triglycerides , cholesterol and insulin and genetic ( seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood obesity ) .
Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children .
Health Surveys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys , 77 percent were obese , and 47 percent in the case of the girls ; in terms of overweight there was also observed a dramatic rise , " said the specialist of the MSSI .
He said the justification for searching the markers is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic history .
He reported that on average , the Mexican has a 65 percent of American Indian heritage , 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight .
He explained that generally , the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consume ( calories ) and which is stored as fat .
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children , which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity .
Even , he said , the presence of dark-colored folds ( acanthuses ) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes .
The information is handled with confidentiality , doctors deliver it in writing to the parents , to whom they explain each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that have to be undertaken in order to prevent disease .
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three major components that cause overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases : sedentary lifestyle , which is the lack of daily physical activity , staying most of the day and watching TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances .
Also it is due to the high caloric intake , meaning , and the increased consumption of sugary drinks , carbohydrate ( tamales , bread , pizza , hamburger , etc . ) with high fat and protein and genetics analyzed in this protocol .
UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera , a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM , develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with the best performance , regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals sent by the road surface were attended , it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valley of Mexico , said Rafael Herrera Najera , a researcher at the Chemistry Faculty ( CF ) of the UNAM , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate , the potholes could be reduced or even completely eliminated .
In his lecture A technological view of the pothole , issued under the International Year of Chemistry , announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt , but with a better mechanical strength , both at high and low temperatures .
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot , as some cities in the north , to improve its performance and , therefore , the formation of potholes .
He explained that the asphalt , the heavier oil part is a set of hydrocarbon molecules , some of high molecular weight , called asphaltenes , and other of low molecular weight , called maltenes , which together give the road surface its viscoelastic characteristic behavior .
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees , it behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C , its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius has a nearly solid state , whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile , he said .
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not uniform , but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature , said the specialist in chemical engineering .
CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement , which is composed of six layers of material , out of which the last three involve the asphalt .
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt , composed of small stones dipped into the asphalt and then compacted .
Each of the stones which compose this covering , he said , is dipped with asphalt .
When driving vehicles and generating effort , it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement .
If it were modified asphalt it would spread even better , said the chemical engineer .
On the asphalt covering , he added , is placed a final layer called rolling covering , which is made ​ ​ of a fine stone material , meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt .
Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle , it must have a better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and provide road friction .
As being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts , the rolling covering also requires proper thickness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration .
The weather , especially humidity and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider , especially water , he said , because it greatly affects the performance of the asphalt .
When the ground is wet , water diffuses inside the covering and it 's hard to get out , this causing a softening of all layers of the pavement and , therefore , the formation of potholes .
In the formation of a pothole , he said , the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asphalt , but the damage does not happen instantly , it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs .
Also a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and , therefore , the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this fulfillment , in order to prevent the frequent formation of potholes .
Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asphalt , for example , asphalt emulsions , which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair potholes with easiness and without using high temperatures .
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts its return match against Bosnia ( 22h00 ) very optimistically , this Tuesday in Lisbon .
On their way there , both teams appeared to lack realism .
" At the end of these 90 minutes , we will be a happy team and most importantly , a happy country . "
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and in the Ukraine .
For him there is not a shadow of a doubt , the Selection , with which he has been at odds since September 2010 , will qualify for Euro 2012 .
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness .
But there is match to play and an opponent , Bosnia to conquer .
In view of the ( 0-0 ) , on Friday in the hell of Zenica it is clear that the games are not over .
Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour , it was not able to reach this precious target , which would have consoled it .
" It is a good result , which nevertheless involves a certain risk "
But on their side , in their illuminated Stade de la Luz in Lisbon , the Portuguese are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic , even if the match is very close , " said an optimistic , but lucid , Bento
" We are expecting a very close match , but we are convinced that we can win , declared the Portuguese trainer aged 42 .
" We continue to have a 50 % chance of being at Euro 2012 , " even under the successor of Carlos Queiroz .
The zero taken on Friday from Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to win .
A zero may be sufficient for the Bosnians .
" It is a good result , which nevertheless carries some risk , regrets Bento .
" We are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players possessing many individual qualities , " he added .
As already in Zenica , the Portuguese would plan to exert maximal pressure on the Bosnians from the start , to " give them no time to think . "
A good idea , provided that it will , prove realistic this time .
The Lake Zurich banking scandal
The most risk-taking bank in Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland .
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling from one crisis to the next ever since .
A German is now to bring it back in line .
Axel Weber certainly had not imagined that would be his role .
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Federal bank , it was announced in July that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013 : Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move .
Axel Weber was clearly delighted , praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues .
" UBS has managed to turn around . "
" I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . "
But by September it was already clear that everything would be very different .
A UBS trader in London had bypassed all the bank 's security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion Euros .
UBS CEO , Oswald Grübel - a banker not only famous in Switzerland - had to go .
The UBS Chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is asking : when will Axel Weber finally arrive ?
Weber is to advise the bank from February 2012 .
And he will take on the role of Chairman of the Board in May , and not in 2013 , the bank announced on Tuesday .
That will be tough for Axel Weber .
He is an economics professor and central banker , not a conventional banker , and clearly would need some time to adjust .
All at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of " Europe 's biggest banking scandal . "
UBS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years .
The proud Swiss bank , it seems , is to be spared nothing .
It began in the financial crisis .
UBS had an excellent reputation until 2007 .
The bank combined the image of the secretive and solid , but equally savvy asset manager with ambitious targets , aiming to become a major player in investment banking .
As a result , in 2007 UBS was managing 1.6 billion , thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world ,
and had risen to the league of the world 's biggest banks as an investment bank .
That made an impression .
The former banker and long-standing banking professor at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich , Hans Geiger , explains : " I always presented UBS to my students as the model of a good bank . "
" From what we know today , you have to ask how I could be so wrong . "
He was very wrong indeed .
It only became clear in 2007 that something was really going very wrong at UBS .
In the middle of the year , CEO Peter Wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly stepped down .
Some months later we could guess at why he had left .
The investment division of the bank had gambled on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions .
UBS announced a capital increase , believe it or not , of 13 billion Swiss francs to face the crisis .
The bank actually managed to find investors , but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined a short while earlier - a less than transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive , even its name was not disclosed .
That was just the first blow .
It got a lot worse in April 2008 .
The bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and Chairman of the Board of Directors , Marcel Ospel - the second best paid chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned .
Catastrophe followed in October 2008 . UBS faced collapse from a lack of investment during the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state .
The National Bank bought up toxic securities from UBS for untold billions and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a mandatory convertible bond to become part owner of the bank .
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks .
After all , the balance sheet total for UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland ( see chart ) .
" We would not be able to save the UBS for a second time , " says banking researcher Geiger .
The second catastrophe followed closely on the heels of the first .
A few months later , UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with the USA and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank .
UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty .
UBS therefore more or less admitted having been an accessory to tax evasion .
At the same time , UBS lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fog of secrecy .
Swiss banking secrecy was not the same after the scandal .
The CEO and the Chairman then resigned and
the exodus of client money began .
The bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion .
And just as things had calmed down and UBS looked like it would start to turn things around , along came a disastrous rogue trader . A single trader gambled away 1.7 billion Euros before the bank noticed something was wrong .
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .
" The Adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too little , " says Martin Janssen , economic and professor of finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich .
The CFO of one major German bank also has no doubts : " The problem facing UBS is that it does not having a handle on risk control . "
It was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made Swiss bankers the guardians of the world 's major assets - no excessive risk , but security for money , whether the world fell apart outside the Alpine republic or not .
The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability , just as Lindt and Sprüngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate .
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - just a bit bigger .
The location alone is classic .
The bank has its head office on Zurich 's Bahnhofstrasse that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake , surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains .
The buildings are ostentatious and the shop rates are among the highest in Europe .
Jewellers such as Tiffany 's are to be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli .
The Swiss banks have resided here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Bär .
A heavy revolving door opens onto the UBS reception .
The walls within are clad in marble behind vast leather armchairs . There is a large sign to the " Safe " next to the bank 's logo .
UBS knows that its clients are looking for - security .
But both the major Swiss banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , at some point ousted the Swiss banking concept - or betrayed it , as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes .
He would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he too , like all Swiss bankers , does business with the two major banks .
He believes UBS has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the Anglo-Saxons are also very active .
In his opinion , the Swiss have nothing to add .
" And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons long ago . "
It was in fact Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS , brought in its first big profits - and then the debacle . No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank .
The catastrophe became evident on 15 October 2008 .
" That Wednesday , the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the nation , " writes author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash .
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs ( around 45 billion Euros ) to save the bank from bankruptcy .
How could it have come to that ?
Talking to Swiss banks , they see the issue mainly in the size of UBS .
Two of the three major Swiss banks consolidated into a single , vast group in June 1998 .
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow .
The fact that the two banks that went to form UBS complemented each other helped . One was a wealthy but sedate bank specialising in asset management in Zurich and the other was less wealthy , but much more internationalised .
The internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an almighty wheel .
Two names are connected with the rise of UBS : Peter Wuffli , Group CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
" I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team , " says the banking research , Hans Geiger .
" Wuffli , highly intellectual , modest , with a deep understanding of models and statistics , and Ospel , with gut instinct who had worked his way up from being a banker 's apprentice . "
But Ospel in the end relied on Wuffli .
And Wuffli ultimately may have made a critical error . " He thought his models were reality , " says Geiger .
" That is tragic . "
Tragic it may be .
Pride comes before a fall .
Employees of UBS clearly remember the management meetings where CEO Wuffli always repeated the same slogan - dethrone Goldman Sachs .
The American bank was the world 's most powerful investment bank .
It led the " league tables " that documented the success of the banks at that time .
UBS wanted to get to the very top of the league .
It managed some of the way .
UBS was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks .
Commissioned management consultants , however , pointed out a weakness . In terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as " fixed income , " UBS was far behind the very largest banks .
UBS had gaps in its US mortgage products .
To plug the hole , UBS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence .
Hungry for growth , the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in US subprime securities .
It developed into a vast machine that packaged up securities based on US mortgage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks .
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out , UBS carried on .
" UBS was buying as late as the summer of 2007 when the US housing market was in flames , " says banking expert Geiger .
The greater the rise , the greater the fall .
One manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated .
Posts at UBS became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day .
Any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job .
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models .
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea - quit investment banking , focus on asset management and turn back to Swiss roots .
The bank , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .
It is clear , nonetheless , that investment banking must shrink significantly .
The new head of the bank , Sergio Ermotti , plans to present his future strategy to the world on Tuesday .
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss banker was actually only imagined as a transitional solution when the bank parted ways unexpectedly with his predecessor Grübel .
Since then , he has proved his mettle and is now to head UBS permanently , the Zurich-based bank announced on Tuesday .
Ermotti plans to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-90s .
He is cutting 3500 jobs .
But that will not be enough .
UBS needs a vision .
What is UBS ?
How does it plan to make money ?
Those are the questions Axel Weber is definitely already asking himself .
Publicly , he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in Zurich .
Next year .
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan to Be Rerouted After Threat of Delayed U.S. Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it 's willing to reroute the project to get it back on track .
TransCanada said Monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska , and is confident the project will still win approval .
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol .
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route .
That comes after the State Department 's announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer , a vast underground water supply .
" This is a real path forward , " Rep. Lee Terry , a Republican from Nebraska , told Fox News .
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department likely would push off any decision until 2013 , after next year 's elections , though officials denied that politics was involved in the decision .
Obama , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the State Department 's call , and expressed support for it .
The 1,700-mile pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico .
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas .
To do so would require it crossing six states .
It is hated by environmentalists but loved by labor groups , who have banked on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer , a major source of drinking water and irrigation .
The State Department 's current Environmental Impact Study found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental impacts , but the energy industry source said the department 's inspector general has ordered a separate probe of the review process , centering on two questions .
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada , Paul Elliott , who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008 , represents a conflict of interest for the program .
The other is whether a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada .
A Stylist Must Also Be a Good Psychologist , Professionals Claim
In the opening article on stylist training , I was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons .
I had no idea what was coming .
Lectures by three experts from the field ; dressing tips for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in practise .
And more is yet to come .
The closer we get to the final exam , the more information and practical tasks await .
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday , but it is really packed with information .
This time , together with Alenka , the Director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry .
A majority of women are not perfectly symmetrical .
One has a short neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper curves , yet another is overweight .
A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders , make the neck look longer , or add the curves necessary .
We were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez , i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .
For example , if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom-made .
You will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless .
In a custom-made skirt , you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting , rolling up , sticking out in your waist , etc .
Boyish figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with ruffling , appliqué , embroidery , or shirring .
Given the abundance of such information and figure types , I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head .
Still , I fear it is too much , with regard to the homework we were given .
Each of the course participants was given a celebrity to create two outfits for : day and night .
We must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
I am to dress Miranda Kerr whom you may know from the Victoria 's Secret campaigns .
Inside I rejoice , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , who has recently gained about a ton ( please , understand I am exaggerating ) , or the very young Selena Gomez .
We must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphically process them .
Moodboard , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction .
It is important to think about the graphic part of styling .
A stylist does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , trendy purses , coats , etc . ) .
This is what a stylist and designer , Mario Kameník , was telling us about .
But that was not until Sunday .
A stylist needs general knowledge
Saturday 's lecture , filled with information on figure types , was livened up by three guests from the field .
A stylist , Honza Pokorný ; a fashion designer , Jakub Polanka ; and a fashion photographer , Ben Renč .
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion , and a stylist should be able to use this fact .
A good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways .
In this case , variability is key .
For example , a trench coat may be worn in the standard way , over jeans and T-shirt , as a coat ; but it may also be worn on naked body , with step-ins , as a dress .
Another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar , and the entire look changes completely .
" Play with it , " he emphasised .
However , I appreciated the following advice the most : " For your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . "
' Then you can start breaking them , ' Jakub told us .
Here I finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .
Not to mention fashion shows .
From Ben , the photographer , I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
So , for a ten-page fashion story ( equals ten outfits ) , I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them .
Now I also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an outfit .
Honza Pokorný confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
Just look at Madonna , who is no miraculous singer , yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star .
The attitude towards stylist services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic .
Even famous people often consider it redundant ( believing it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .
And if someone finally lets us create their styling , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .
Then , we are left to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining / losing weight , etc .
On Sunday , both Honza and Mario were stressing the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an outfit .
Our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress ; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist .
To be able to estimate people , not to pander , and stick to one 's opinion .
" If a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces , you cannot throw out her entire wardrobe telling her how awful the clothes are . "
" Find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with " Mario says .
He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain .
That is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need .
Aside from the obvious things , such as scissors , a sticky roller , or safety pins , it should have a nylon thread ( for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats ) , special clip-ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large ( pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a sewing set .
To have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly underlay shoe soles .
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the soles might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside .
And so we were sticking away .
You must not touch the shoes with the scissors , to avoid any damage .
This requires real skill .
Mario pleased me by praising my job .
The skills mentioned are really not my cup of tea .
This is just a fragment of what we heard during the second weekend course session .
I am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake , no matter what people say .
V Need for Speed : The Run takes place across America .
Review
An originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes .
The ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
Before it was released , the new version subtitled The Run created high expectations .
It promised to shift the old Need For Speed racing series in a new direction ; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre .
We were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs .
Typical for the NFS series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
The game represents a possibly decent arcade race , but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years .
This means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers .
The adventure opens very well .
You are introduced into a story , where the main character , Jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America .
You get in the car on the west coast , in San Francisco , and your task is to be the first one to reach New York .
The idea brings several interesting features .
The route is divided into ten stages , subdivided into over fifty races .
This means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
One thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things .
Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
Still , it is nothing world-shattering .
Driving through the desert , autumnal countryside , or high in snow-covered mountains is visually very pleasant though .
In addition , the races are , from time to time , enlivened by an untypical feature .
For example , in the desert , you get into a sandstorm , significantly decreasing the visibility .
On the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be careful not to get under an avalanche .
Individual races are ordered fairly well .
There are just a few types , but it is sufficient .
For a while , you try to overtake a number of competitors ( basically a regular race ) ; then you try to beat the time ( standard stopwatch race ) ; or you are in a duel with a single rival .
On top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult .
The parts outside the car are new .
They are just interactive animations , where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time .
Nothing difficult .
It is a surprise though , that these parts are much less in number than you would expect ( just three to be precise ) .
It actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be boring ; within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining .
The driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts .
This means that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .
If you are looking for a real-to-life simulation , you will have to look elsewhere .
Still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing , even though we could find better at the competition .
So far , everything is just right .
However , after some time , problems come .
In contrast with the driving model , the collision model is not that good .
From a game of this type , one does not expect complicated deformations and collisions , but when you have no idea , before crashing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
Typically , when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic , you sometimes lightly touch the other car . Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes .
Or , crashed completely .
This is not such a big deal due to the restart system , but is enough to spoil the fun .
The restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .
Nevertheless , there are only five restarts available per each race .
If you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .
This makes it an aid in case something does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .
Sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
A significant shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places .
For example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration , no matter if you come first , fifth , five seconds earlier , or one minute later .
This is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down .
It makes no difference when you get to them ; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose .
The competitors have other advantages , too .
While playing the game , you find several places , where , regardless of time , the same competitor overtakes you at the very same spot .
This is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .
Obviously , your rival has to get in front of you no matter what .
The thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section .
One can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and adrenalin-filled , but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly .
It 's a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
It is not important whether the reason you do not get bored is the concept with fifty unique tracks , ordering of races , or something else .
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual .
You have to watch out for gas stations along the way , as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient .
Cars are divided into three categories .
Sports cars are suitable for cities ; strong American cars for straight highway sections ; and exotic supersports cars for technical driving , such as along crooked mountain tracks .
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .
Here , you gain both medals and experience points for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .
Various features unlock fir getting a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds .
Again , the profile is interconnected with an on-line Autolog function , which , among other things , compares the results you have reached with those of other players , and ensures community functions .
Yet another setback difficult to understand ; is the situation from the last race in the story .
You and your car get into a subway tunnel ( let 's say you do ) , where you speed down the tracks in the darkness ( let 's say you do ) .
Your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( let 's say it does ) , when suddenly , a subway train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a pile of scrap metal .
For several days , our editorial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such morons .
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary ; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .
It is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases rather tragically , decreases .
This especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where fluent recoding would not help you much anyway .
The sound is all right ; the soundtrack is a matter of taste .
In order to please the widest possible young audience , the soundtrack is ' flecked in from all quarters ' ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .
Overall impression of Need for Speed : The Run is quite confused .
If the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that The Run is the best part of NFS for the past several years .
However , the game feels unfinished .
It surely is a nice entertainment , but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights .
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obama 's healthcare law , two of its justices , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court .
The occasion was last Thursday , when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review .
One of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the sweeping healthcare overhaul passed by Congress last year , a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists nationwide .
The justices agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 5 1 / 2-hour argument is expected in March , and the outcome is likely to further roil the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time the court 's decision is released .
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul Clement , who served as U.S. solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration .
Clement 's law firm , Bancroft PLLC , was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles .
Another firm that sponsored the dinner , Jones Day , represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law , the National Federation of Independent Business .
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court 's conference over the case .
In attendance was , among others , Mitch McConnell , the Senate 's top Republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law .
The featured guests at the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas .
It 's nothing new : The two justices have been attending Federalist Society events for years .
And it 's nothing that runs afoul of ethics rules .
In fact , justices are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices .
If they were , they arguably fell under code 's Canon 4C , which states , " A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of honor , or featured on the program of such an event . "
Nevertheless , the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists .
" This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code belies claims by several justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said Bob Edgar , the president of Common Cause .
" The justices were wining and dining at a black-tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court . "
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda-driven groups such as the Federalist Society .
And Thomas " wife , Ginni , is a high-profile conservative activist .
Moreover , conservatives argue that it 's Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue , not Scalia and Thomas .
Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .
Kagan has given no indication she will do so .
Boeing gets record $ 18-billion jetliner order
Emirates airline orders 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jetliners with an option for 20 more .
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air , a deal worth more than $ 1 billion .
It 's rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product .
But it 's a big deal when the company is airplane-maker Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 airplanes totals a record $ 18 billion .
Just as big is where Boeing got the order : the Middle East , a growing gold mine of future airplane orders .
In a forecast released Monday , the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East over the next 20 years will need 2,520 airplanes worth $ 450 billion .
Boeing over the weekend announced its biggest-ever order by dollar value for commercial airplanes - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets .
The blockbuster order came from Emirates airline in Dubai .
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes , which would push the total list price to $ 26 billion , Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show .
Then on Monday , Boeing said Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s , the so-called Dreamliner , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger amenities .
List price for six of those is more than $ 1 billion .
" This is clearly a huge positive for Boeing , " Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said .
" The quality of these particular customers is pretty strong . "
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations .
So , not only do they have the money to pay for planes , but a surge in fuel prices - usually damaging to airlines because it 's one of their biggest costs - is not as detrimental because the country is making money on the higher price of oil .
That 's important because they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise , Dihora said .
" They have a natural hedge , " he said .
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing 's lead in the market for wide-body planes and helps hold at bay competitor Airbus SAS ' attempt to encroach on its dominance with the A350 airliner .
Boeing 's win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would push back the debut of the largest A350 , which competes directly with the 777-300ER .
It delayed the debut to add more thrust after customers demanded more payload and range .
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5 % to $ 67.94 .
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide , says a committee of experts
Canadians are living half dead , according to a report of the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding palliative medicine , the committee claims that governments , healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible palliative care , apart from cancer cases .
Canadian society is half dead .
Only 9 % of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end .
This is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada , in which six experts in different fields took part , including ethics , the law and medicine .
This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code , so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision .
At the outset , the experts cite a recent inquiry by the Economist Intelligence Unit , which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide .
Whilst Canada is placed 10th , the study notes that " the medicalisation of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject of death .
Medicalisation or not , 77 % of Canadians do not have access to palliative care , report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada .
And 86 % of them end by dying in hospital
Countrywide , it is in Quebec that the rate is highest , with 86 % of deaths taking place in hospital .
On the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide , the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the Federal government , which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide .
Now , according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised , there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application , that is to say , the practice of euthanasia , or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent , or not consenting .
On the contrary , affirmed during a teleconference , Jocelyn Downie , who submitted the report , more such cases were found precisely in those countries , where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised .
" Euthanasia is practised in Canada , where it is clearly illegal . "
" Assisted suicide is practised in Canada , where it is clearly illegal , explains Jocelyn Downie .
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 % of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia , because according to an Angus Reid enquiry in 2010 , they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering .
And the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handicapped persons had less value .
Regarding persons who commit assisted suicide , investigations indicate that 41 % of such cases should not have been prosecuted .
Regarding the continuation , or the withdrawal of nursing care of a patient , the situation is less clear , say the authors of the report .
They also suggest among their other recommendations , that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal .
The committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nursing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution .
Regarding palliative care , the committee calls on governments , nursing institutions , and doctors to work together to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer .
Lastly , concerning palliative sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions , the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain , as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures .
Reservations of other experts
Certain experts in the field of the health-related legislation have already voiced reservations concerning the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada experts ' report .
Maître Pierre Deschamps , a specialist in health legislation , described as " extreme " the position of the experts who signed the report , because among other things , it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to terminal cases .
" This opens the door on a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old , could ask for help to commit suicide , says Me Deschamps , who yesterday consulted a summary of the report .
Me Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
He says that " in society there are signposts and constraints .
The specialist in health legislation , Margaret Somerville also expressed " strong opposition to the conclusions of the report , which she described as being " obviously pro-euthanasia . "
Margaret Somerville , who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada , contests , in particular , the data of the report concerning abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised as in The Netherlands and in Oregon .
The world according to the republican presidential candidates
Concerning China , Iran , aid to Israel , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , and Rick Perry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge .
Can an America weakened by crisis , lead a complex world by simple and indeed , simplistic , ideas ?
To listen to republican presidential candidates , the electors might believe it .
For some days , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry and the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations , which are traditionally a republican strong suit .
Concerning China , Iran and aid to Israel , the slogans , are often fused together .
Mitt Romney , the best placed for nomination of the " Grand Old Party , " threatened to drag the Chinese before the OMC and to accuse them of " manipulation of their currency , a sensitive subject in an America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of its industry to Asia .
So much the worse if this should trigger a trade war , he said .
Jon Huntsman , Obama 's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions .
He called for a muscular , but a constructive , dialogue with Peking ( the current position of Obama ) .
But Huntsman , who is stagnating at the bottom of the polls , remains inaudible .
In the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran , if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme .
" If I am elected , I will stop Iran , he trumpeted . "
" If Obama is re-elected , they will have the bomb . "
Hr also promised to increase military aid to Israel , accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner .
The entrepreneur Herman Cain , the second best-placed candidate , declares an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files .
Recently , he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat , because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that China has possessed it since 1964 !
The Texas governor Rick Perry , who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran , says that he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico against the drug cartels .
Resort to the torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009 , is also recommended by Cain , Perry and by the candidate Michele Bachmann .
One is far away from the 2008 republican candidate John McCain , a foreign policy heavyweight .
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war .
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning anti-terrorism .
They insist with good reason on the setback of his naive dialogue with Iran on the premature departure of the " boys " from Iraq , his tergiversations in Libya labelling him weak .
But the attack is not so easy .
The population judges as positive Obama 's the balance of national security , which eliminated Bin Laden .
Since Iraq , it distrusts military interventions , which run into quicksands .
And in arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to revive its leadership , Obama is right .
Energy policy :
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via short-term considerations , or under the stress of emotion , it is energy policy .
The availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies .
It is healthy that an electoral rendezvous should be an occasion for reflecting on such stakes and the place occupied by nuclear power .
The debate will not be fruitful , unless it explores all the economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .
The French must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data .
Now that we are 7 thousand million human beings on the planet , demographic development will involve a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050 , unless a huge proportion of the world 's population is deprived of a vital element .
During the same period , it will become necessary to palliate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without forgetting the overriding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight climatic imbalance , a subject which has vanished from the ecological debate .
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters .
This is why Germany is isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear energy .
This is not the case of Belgium , which subordinates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , or that of Switzerland , which intends to build only the most modern ones .
On the other hand , Great Britain , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India , Brazil to quote only a few , pursue their projects with determination .
The United States , decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre , which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident .
Although the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example , the reality contradicts that argument .
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity , an increased energy dependence aggravated by increased recourse to imported gas , in particular from Russia , a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres .
In a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt .
The case of Denmark should be considered .
Champion of Europe in the construction of turbines , from which it draws 30 % of its electricity , it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to intermittent wind ; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65 % and 50 % higher than the European average .
On the other hand , thanks to the constancy of energy policy , our neighbours pay 40 % more for their electricity than French households .
Since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory , French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe .
Due to this , any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity , which would render illusory the fine declarations on re-industrialisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power .
A price , which a large majority of the French refuse to pay , all the more so , since they do not object to this form of energy in principle .
It should be recalled that the energy policy of our country made it possible to establish an industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 resulting ones .
Strongly export-oriented , it attracts a galaxy of specialised RME 's in international markets and creates many jobs , which cannot be moved elsewhere .
If France decided to abandon nuclear power , she would sacrifice a large number of these RME 's and lose the annual 6 thousand million Euro 's worth of French exports of nuclear equipment and services .
What electrician would recommend a EPR designed to function for sixty years , if the decline of its manufacture was programmed ?
To solve the energy equation , it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity .
The development by Areva of low carbon dioxide emission solutions , nuclear and renewable , bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy .
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety , is absolutely vital .
In France , we have a safety authority , which exercises an intransigent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as Flamanville .
Our teams , whose professionalism is recognised , are accustomed to the same safety-related obsession .
In a space of 50 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents .
Only one , Three Mile Island , occurred under normal operating conditions , but without any human or environmental consequences .
At Tchernobyl , the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error brought about the drama .
At Fukushima , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude , which caused the death of tens of thousands of people .
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as it has from its two predecessors .
The fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities , the operators and French and German constructors , the EPR presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena .
Since it is being considered by all electricians wishing to construct a generation centre , a decision to construct it at Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by clearing their way to seizing the leadership of the unavoidable development of nuclear energy .
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country , but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion , dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate the debate , which is so decisive for the economic , social and financial situation of our country .
Europe invented democracy , thinks in terms of European democracy
Democracy is a precious possession ; it is also a fragile one .
The European continent should be able to remember that having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago , it experienced during the XXth century the tragedies of the World War , of totalitarisms , the Holocaust , the gulag , but also Franco in Spain , Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece .
Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible .
It is known that since the time of Napoleon it was a matter of faculty of thinking .
Universal suffrage , in order to be the sine qua non of democracy , is not enough and can actually become a " tool of oppression " as once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot .
No , democracy requires a lot more , a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and control of powers , education , the Lumieres , economic and social solidarity , justice .
The European crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy .
In this respect , the palinode of a true-false Greek referendum will have a double revelatory value , that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy , but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its incongruity .
This ambivalence must be thought through , in order that it can be bypassed .
The truth is that the lines of the forefront of democratic struggle have now moved , and that for many , the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction .
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums organised as required and in a confused sequence .
The " free hand " of an absolute European monarch , or a jump with tied feet into the nationalist void ; what a choice for a citizen !
No , we do not want the blades of a guillotine , but an exercise , joint , serene and ongoing , of choice and of democracy , this time on European level .
There are no crises in Greece , Italy , Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them , because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe .
It is the whole of Europe , which defers to the dictates of the markets and of rating agencies , who suffer from their incapacity and a lack of solidarity .
It is all Europe , which is humiliated on the international scene .
There is disquiet about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe , but it is the entire Europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and with its each of its nations .
The urgency concerns the return to popular sovereignty , the direction of the European project .
Because it is by all working together , that Europeans will be able reduce the weight of their individual debts , to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it .
Emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on European level , which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster .
After having long fought this proposal by specialists and of Jacques Delors , the whole world now calls for a European economic government .
Let is be so .
But the idea without stronger economic , political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens , would be a fresh folly and a new impasse .
We must launch a new stage of European construction .
To establish the Republic in France , it was necessary to " make " republicans .
The Revolution of interests would not be enough .
This lesson remains valid .
We must construct a Europe integrated on economic level .
This can only be done by constructing a more democratic Europe on political level , a real popular European sovereignty .
To make Europe , let us make Europeans .
Quintet included the country on the tour for celebrating two decades of experience
' Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true '
In an exclusive interview with Viva , the bassist Jeff Ament , of Pearl Jam , said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium .
There were more than 20 years of wait , but the band says that for the member is also a dream turned into reality playing in the country .
This was stated by the bassist and founding member , Jeff Ament , who spoke exclusively with Viva , from Brazil , last week .
The group is on the South American zone within the tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20th will make its only stop in Central America .
That day they will be present at the National Stadium , starting at 7 : 30 pm , together with the band of Los Angeles The X and the band of the nationals Las Robertas .
This is an excerpt of the conversation , whose full transcript is online in The Nation .
For your followers from Costa Rica , is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica ? Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing ?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too .
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great .
I 've been to Costa Rica only once , on vacation , it is a beautiful country and I think we 'll be able to stay a few days there .
So we are excited to bring our music there .
I ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the band ; the fans live with intensity the days before the concert .
What do you say to your most fervent followers ?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years .
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica , thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here .
Some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year .
Does this add a bit of pressure on your visit ?
Some of the biggest shows we 've played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks .
We had a few wonderful shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica .
Really , we are very eager to play there .
We love this country , we love to surf and the jungle , for both things , Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world .
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing ?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible .
My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua , along with Mexico , these are great places to surf , and that 's how we learned about , through people who love surfing .
Viewing the tour , one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs .
What have you planned for the presentation in Costa Rica ?
As we have never played there before , then we have no restrictions on what we can do .
We will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of songs ; we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire .
You never repeat the repertoire .
How come ?
I think it 's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs , so it 's difficult to choose which songs to play every night .
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not been playing for a while , this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten .
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for the people .
With this tour , you are celebrating 20 years of experience .
Looking back , is it hard to believe all you have made ?
Yes , absolutely .
First , I think none of us could ever imagine we 'd be in a rock band and doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream .
We count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue making music together .
We all love each other and love making music .
We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go .
Things could not be better for us .
What does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge ?
It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands .
We are good friends of the people of Soundgarden , Mudhoney and Alice in Chains .
It 's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual .
From time to time , arises a band of a city , but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city .
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group .
I still play with some of them from time to time .
Last year , we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney , we saw Soundgarden in its tour , so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that aroused .
It is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same members for so long .
Yes , four of us were together for 21 years and Matt ( Cameron ) joined us 13 years ago , which , by itself , is much longer than many bands lasted .
First , I think we are all lucky to be still alive and , secondly , we all care about the others .
We are all very close friends and , thanks to this , there have also been opened musical avenues that give each the freedom to experiment .
We trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better .
Your relationship to the word fame has not been easy ; but thanks to your success , you have been able to do whatever you wanted .
How do you find a balance ?
As we have grown , it has been easier to find a balance .
We take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music .
While one remembers that people are there for the music , that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it , without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star , something that none of us really cares about .
How do you remember your other project Manother Love Bone ?
I think we write very good songs and at the beginning was a great thing .
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after the death of Andy ( Andrew Woods ) .
There were many frustrations because lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of Bruce ( Fair-weather ) and Greg ( Gilmore ) , who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made ​ ​ me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , laugh , talk about music and football and much more .
It was a remarkable man and we miss him .
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica .
Is it true that you know its work , especially Eddie Vedder , and that 's why you chose it for the opening ?
Yes , the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most , so we 're anxious to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining .
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live ?
That is a question for Ed ( Eddie Vedder ) , so I do not know .
He sings it and I think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind .
As a bassist , what are your influences ?
There are so many .
Within the first that come to my mind are Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C.J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love .
How did Pearl Jam succeeded to maintain grunge relevant despite of not being any longer a fad ?
I think all of us feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge .
When I think of it , it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before , like Mudhoney , Soundgarden , Nirvana and all that came at the same time , and if it is important now , I think it 's wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are making now music better than ever .
At first , your music had a darker content , and now has become more positive .
How do you explain this change ?
It 's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the album that may appear lighter , but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive .
With both , when Ed played them , I cried when I heard them , and these songs are profoundly dark .
I think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or friend , these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs certainly represent that for me .
Also , I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark .
Military Faces Mounting Pressure to Crack Down on Rape
This week , a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for alleged inaction on rape .
If not , hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one .
Pfc . Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a fellow soldier .
It was October 2008 , and she was heading back to her barracks at Miramar Air Station , just north of San Diego , after dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer .
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink .
" A red flag went up , " Lyman says .
But the Texas native brushed aside her concern .
I thought , no , he 's 19 .
" He 's from Texas , " she says .
" I wish I had listened to my instincts . "
Within minutes of entering Lyman 's room , the man came up from behind her , throwing her down and raping her , she alleges .
This week , on Nov . 18 , Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will anxiously await a court ruling in a historic hearing to be held in Arlington , Va . , that will decide whether a suit they have brought against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , will go to trial .
The suit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to curtail widespread rape within the military , in violation of soldiers " constitutional rights .
Filed in February by Susan Burke , a Washington , D.C. , attorney , the suit initially involved 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men , all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers , and that the military failed to investigate , prosecute , or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks .
Burke says she is going after the military 's top brass because the problem begins with them .
" The military is a top-down structure , " she says .
" Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation ? The top leadership . "
Burke also says that since February , she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors , many of whom could be part of future suits .
Her strategy : rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one basket , so to speak - she will file multiple cases , if need be , to keep the pressure on .
The defense team for the Department of Defense , led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride , has filed a motion to dismiss the case .
The court papers , obtained by Newsweek , detail the defense strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces .
Per a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine , the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by active-duty personnel .
" The alleged harms are incident to plaintiffs " military service , " the documents say .
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this story .
Things have changed since the ' 50s .
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat , that distinction is in name only : modern wars rarely have clear front lines .
In both Iraq and Afghanistan , teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones .
The result : between those two wars , 150 female soldiers have died - two thirds of them during combat situations .
It 's time for the military to modernize as well , Burke says .
She isn 't alone in her fight ; three other lawsuits are under way in addition to hers .
At Yale Law School , the Veterans " Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere .
Separately , the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is assembling a suit against the military that focuses on the " personality disorder " diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence , according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women 's Action Network , a human-rights group .
Her group filed a suit in December against the Veterans Administration , charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service .
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes .
In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported , according to the Department of Defense 's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office .
But assaults are notoriously underreported , and by the Pentagon 's own estimate , that figure accounts for approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year .
The report , released in March , also examines prosecution rates : in 2010 , 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system .
The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas .
In Lyman 's case , she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred .
That night , she says , she was asked to recount the details of her rape 11 separate times to a stream of police , doctors , and commanders .
She did a rape kit , and her assailant 's blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .
Six months later , in April 2009 , Lyman sat through a hearing before a judge , during which she was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack .
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was eventually acquitted .
" I remember the day when the verdict was read , " Lyman says .
" I thought I was going to go into labor - I ran screaming from the courtroom . "
" They put me into the psychiatric unit , and when I got out , I remember saying to my command officer , " That wasn 't his trial . That was my trial . " "
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist , who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder , rendering her unfit for service .
In January 2010 she was discharged under less-than-honorable terms , preventing her from receiving any benefits .
As for whether the case filed by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs moves forward , it 's a long shot , says John Turley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School .
However , he notes , " In my view they should be able to move forward . "
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first issued .
I 've been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine .
The military is decades behind because they don 't have the same incentive and deterrent posed by liability .
He adds , " The odds are heavily against them ... but it 's important for them to try . "
These things only change when good people are willing to fight .
If the hearing doesn 't go their way , Burke , the plaintiffs " lawyer , will cue up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases .
" We will continue battling the military on this issue until reform occurs , " she says .
Or until we die , whichever comes first .
After an Earlier Misstep , a Minutely Planned Raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved , some of them wearing riot helmets .
The overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park would be at its emptiest .
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers , with others initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise .
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center , his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the Police Department .
There could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks , like the pepper-spraying of protesters , that violated department rules and created a firestorm of public sympathy for the squatters .
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and training .
Officials had prepared by watching how occupations in other cities played out .
A major disaster drill was held on Randalls Island , with an eye toward Zuccotti .
Officials increased so-called disorder training - counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on Lower Manhattan .
The last training session was on Monday night , on the Manhattan side of the East River .
The orders to move into the park came down at the " last minute , " said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the assignment only as " an exercise . "
" The few cops that I know that were called into this thing , they were not told it was for going into Zuccotti Park , " said the person , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
" The only people who were aware of them going into Zuccotti Park were at the very highest levels of the department . "
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city .
On Oct . 14 , officials wanted to clear the park , but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans .
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units , including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high-crime neighborhoods .
Mr . Kelly said many people , almost like commuters , had been coming and going from the park during the day , making 1 a.m. a good time to move in .
" It was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park , " he said .
Emergency Service Unit trucks with klieg lights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive , near the Manhattan Bridge , before moving out .
The lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to cow many protesters .
As the community affairs officers moved into the park in their light-blue windbreakers , many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left .
No tents were touched until 1 : 45 a.m. , the police said , giving the protesters time to gather their belongings .
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to move in if arrests were needed in the park .
Reporters in the park were forced to leave .
Paul J. Browne , the Police Department 's chief spokesman , said it was for their safety .
But many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .
Mr . Browne said television camera trucks on Church Street , along the park 's western border , were able to capture images .
As the police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters " personal belongings , including luggage and plastic lawn and leaf bags stuffed with clothing , crews from the Sanitation Department followed , scooping up what was left behind .
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out , the images appearing on the Internet soon after .
A core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampment 's kitchen area , near the center of the park .
Some made a barrier , and the police moved in to methodically arrest them .
About 10 people in the epicenter of the encampment locked themselves together by their arms .
And two people chained themselves to trees , Mr. Kelly said .
Emergency service officers were called in to cut the locks .
No arrests were made in the park until about 3 : 30 a.m. , Mr. Kelly said .
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later , the police said .
Mr . Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park .
Most of the arrests were for " disorderly conduct and resisting arrest , " he said .
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito , the chief of department , the top uniformed officer in the department .
Phil T. Pulaski , the department 's chief of detectives , was also there .
Mr . Kelly , while present , was " not directing operations , " Mr. Browne said .
A second group of officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway , between Liberty and Cedar Streets , in case they had to move in .
Barricades were set up at Cortlandt Street , a block north of the park , and at Pine Street , a block south .
From those positions , the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from Zuccotti Park .
At one point , several officers , many with shields , were seen pushing people farther out .
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter .
Some of the rowdiest action of the night took place south of the park .
Around 5 a.m. , south of Pine Street , one protester jumped on the hood of a police car , and others were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van .
At one point , a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd .
In the end , one officer and one protester were hospitalized .
Mass Slaughter on a Personal Level
Peter Englund 's intense and bighearted new book , " The Beauty and the Sorrow : An Intimate History of the First World War , " begins with a long dramatis personae of the sort that can make your heart sink .
Here is advice for proceeding : Gently excise this page and make it your bookmark .
You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr. Englund 's novelistic telling , and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS , a beacon during those few moments when , like one of his men and women , you are confused and bereft in the fog of war .
Mr . Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist .
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy , which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature .
What he has written here is an unusual book , one he describes , not inaccurately , as " a work of anti-history . "
It contains few big names , major treaties or famous battles ; there are almost no ambassadors , dashing journalists or discussions of tactics and materiel .
It 's not so much a book about what happened , he explains , as " a book about what it was like . " It 's about " feelings , impressions , experiences and moods . "
" The Beauty and the Sorrow " threads together the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women , on both sides of the war , from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers , doctors , ambulance drivers and clerks .
A few of these people will become heroes .
A few will become prisoners of war , or lose limbs , go mad or die .
Their lives flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church ; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out .
Mr . Englund 's book is a deviation from standard history books .
It is a corrective too to the notion that World War I was only about the dire trench warfare on the Western Front .
" The Beauty and the Sorrow " expertly pans across other theaters of war : the Alps , the Balkans , the Eastern Front , Mesopotamia , East Africa .
Soldiers in this book have beehives fall on them ; one has Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids ; tsetse flies are an intractable problem .
This is a moving book , almost from the start .
War floods these people 's lives like a natural catastrophe , a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite .
When cannon fire is heard in the distance , and you are a woman at home with your children , do you stay or flee ?
Who is coming , anyway ?
Almost no one understands what 's happening , even why this war is to be fought .
" Lack of facts , " Mr. Englund observes , " has been padded out with guesses , suppositions , hopes , fears , idées fixes , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumors . "
" The Beauty and the Sorrow " follows individuals like Florence Farmborough , an English nurse in the Russian Army , and Richard Stumpf , a young German high-seas fleet seaman .
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs , letters and other already published material .
The accounts of their lives can be terrifying or stirring , but are most fully alive in Mr. Englund 's accumulation of small moments , stray details .
Many of these are about deprivation and making do .
In telling a German schoolgirl 's story he says : " Ersatz , everywhere ersatz . "
" Substitute coffee , fake aluminum , imitation rubber , paper bandages , wooden buttons . "
He goes on about the ersatz food in Germany .
He describes " meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat ( and finished off with a fake bone made of wood ) ; tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel ; shoes soled with wood . "
There are , he notes , " 837 registered meat substitutes permissible in the production of sausages , 511 registered coffee substitutes . "
Some stories are about honor and bravery .
One American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and declares about war : " You feel that , after all , this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and whiskey , the evening paper or the best seller , and to pretend that such a veneer means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt front . "
Conversely a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die , and that no one will notice or care .
" Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself , one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience , " he writes .
Instead , it is horribly like " a condemned man being strangled secretly . "
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away , and about new types of terror .
" The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , " Mr. Englund writes , " a war between factories . "
He catches the arrival of what he calls " a new species in the bestiary of the young century : the articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-cut clothes who performs his butchery while sitting behind a desk . "
People behave in unanticipated ways ; there is as much base behavior as heroism .
Mr . Englund discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front .
" The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus , which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital , " he writes .
" Those who are really desperate rub it into their eyes , which often results in lifelong blindness . "
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves , Mr. Englund 's prose is supple but unshowy , perfectly suited to his humane task .
In dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war has " unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces : extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . "
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight .
The best books about World War I have often been oblique , like Paul Fussell 's " Great War and Modern Memory , " or novels , like Erich Maria Remarque 's " All Quiet on the Western Front , " rather than comprehensive histories .
Mr . Englund 's volume joins an unconventional pantheon .
His book has the most devastating ending I can remember in a piece of nonfiction .
I won 't give it away .
But it 's as if he has reached from his book , snatched that dramatis personae page from your fingers , and lighted it with a match .
Agricultural commodities speculation
Deutsche Bank has commodity trading investigated
By Christian Teevs
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading agricultural commodities ?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE , Josef Ackermann has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world .
The CEO plans to make changes in January .
Hamburg -
For German citizens the situation is clear . According to one study , 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize .
Two thirds of those questioned demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities , as trading deepens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world .
The findings were made in a survey conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch .
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October .
The author of the report , Harald Schumann , shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger .
The campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank , Josef Ackermann , although large banking houses such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way .
Originally , commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting traders against price fluctuations .
However , most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest .
In contrast to US competitors , Ackermann has responded to the criticism . He has promised to investigate the accusations and has said that no trade is " worth putting Deutsche Bank 's good reputation at risk . "
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE , an international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report .
The investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Bank 's board of managing directors - with recommendations for action .
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January .
Commodities trading may be reduced or stopped completely .
Ackermann working on his image
The president of Foodwatch , Thilo Bode , welcomed the news while emphasising his criticism of the financial sector . " Betting on rising food prices is an extreme example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . "
As top bank lobbyist , Ackermann has a particular duty , according to Bode .
" Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices , " said Bode .
" It does not matter whether this is about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank . "
Ackermann 's sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the CEO would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office .
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been planned .
Cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could improve his image .
He also need have little concern for the costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome .
One in two people would withdraw commodities investments
Foodwatch is striving to keep up the pressure on the manager .
To date , more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organisation 's campaign .
Bode published the survey on Tuesday . The survey was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November and 1001 people took part .
No more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs .
Many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading . According to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation .
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank .
21er Haus in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs , lows and a happy-ever-after . Austria 's Pavilion for the 1958 World 's Fair in Brussels won prizes , became a museum in Vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition centre .
Austria 's pavilion , designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World 's Fair , is a famous textbook example of modern post-war architecture with its clear shapes , glass halls , bold strokes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress .
Schwanzer 's pavilion won the Grand Prix d 'Architecture in 1958 for its light floating steel-glass structure .
The building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture .
It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria 's pavilion at the next world 's fair .
He finally shot to fame internationally in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW Tower and its bowl-shaped sister building .
The pavilion , planned as a temporary exhibition building , was relocated to the Schweizer Garten near Vienna 's Südbahnhof , converted and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is widely referred to as the " 20er Haus " for this reason .
However , the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning .
Nonetheless , it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new home .
The building stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now renovated the pavilion , which has been named the " 21er Haus " and will be used as a contemporary art museum .
The museum is a branch of the Belvedere museum , which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .
Agnes Husslein-Arco who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007 was instrumental in the new beginning .
Husslein-Arco , an art history graduate with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice skater , who went on to Sotheby 's , the Guggenheim Museum and to become the founding director of the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg , convinced politicians and conservators to go ahead with renovation , attracted public funding and private sponsorship and decided on the use of the building .
The new museum was to house the Fritz Wotruba Foundation 's permanent collection , a café and a bookshop alongside contemporary art . An office building was also to be built .
Strict supervision &amp; limited budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal choice to carry out the project .
He was known , of course , for having renovated and expanded Joseph Olbrich 's Secession in Vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was an " exceptionally important place " for him where had visited exhibitions " almost every weekend . "
He knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing , a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and converted .
The problems facing the latest alterations were much greater . The building was " an energy guzzler , " says Krischanitz .
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced , fibreglass-reinforced safety glass was put in and the glass roof was replaced by high-grade safety glass .
Thermal bridge steel girders were strengthened or replaced and asbestos was removed from ceilings .
Two lower floors created space for the new use of the building , a sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the delicate Schwanzer pavilion .
The original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old red-brown colour of rust-proofing .
And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be .
All this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget .
" We often had to find a material that was good , cheap and met with the approval of the monument authority , " says Krischanitz , pointing to the rough flooring in the basement .
The building has remained flexible and light despite the constraints , problems and conversions .
Krischanitz stated recently that the pavilion " from Brussels " had been tough - a typical " drop in the city " story .
Architecture like this is " always in the wrong place " and nonetheless wants to " stimulate a real awareness . "
The 21er Haus is very much in the right place , as there has been a stroke of luck in town planning . The completely redesigned " main station quarter " with offices and residential properties is developing around the Schweizer Garten .
There may also be a second stroke of luck . The 21er Haus may be bolstered by another Krischanitz building - the collector Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Schweizer Garten .
Walls Have Eyes : How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe , Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online .
On Monday , Breivik , who admitted to a killing spree in Norway in July which left 77 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .
While Breivik may have acted alone , he was far from alone in cyberspace : he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer , chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social-networking sites .
After this summer 's tragedy , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
But how to find them ?
Easy - just log on to Facebook .
" We realized that it wasn 't that difficult to get to them at all , " says Jamie Bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by British think tank DEMOS .
Facebook 's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic , says Bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the site 's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years .
Bartlett 's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads , but instead of linking to a new band or diet product , the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level , attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future .
By reaching out through Facebook , Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without ever leaving the office .
" It 's quite a new way of doing research , " Bartlett says .
Some of the results aren 't all that surprising : online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young , male , and vexed by immigration .
But in something of a twist , " those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable , more democratic and less violent than those who just remain behind the computer screen . "
DEMOS 's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
Think tanks , medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in ' Likes ' , wall posts and status updates .
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day , the Facebook " data supernova " is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site 's name in the title up almost 800 % over the past five years .
For some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldn 't approach with a clipboard on the street .
" Before , when you tried to survey people from the British National Party , it would be very difficult to identify them . "
" You 'd have to go through the party and they would never allow you access , " says Bartlett .
" Facebook cuts all that out - you go to them directly . "
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and tackle social-health problems .
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin , Madison and her colleagues found that undergraduates who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic .
Moreno suggests that students ' peers , such as residential advisors , could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts one too many boozy status updates .
" You can 't treat a problem if you can 't diagnose it , " Dimitri Christakis , Moreno 's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health , Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children 's Research Institute , told the Washington Post .
" We 've found a way to identify kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed . "
Facebook , too , is constantly tapping into its own population for data .
The site 's Data Team has worked up stats on relationship status and Valentine 's Day , voter turnout in the 2010 midterms , and a National Happiness Index ( mainly using information only it can access - champions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast trove of data available to others for research . )
But Facebook 's users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information .
But what about when Facebook users become part of a survey they don 't even know about ?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline , online it 's a free-for-all .
" I don 't think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles , " says Neil Selwyn , a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab , of a 2006 study he conducted using students ' public Facebook walls .
" As far as they were concerned , it was just between them and their friends . "
Then there 's the question of methodology .
Even offline , there 's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest .
On Facebook , it 's impossible to know how much of a user 's profile information and wall posts are true .
" What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things , " says Selwyn .
Which is why , despite his years as a technology researcher , Selwyn thinks a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use .
" There 's no substitute for going into the real world and speaking to real people , " he says .
" Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still takes place offline . "
7 Lessons From the Lost Steve Jobs Interview , Showing at a Theater This Week
Following the death of Steve Jobs on Oct . 5 , there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - singling out the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor .
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview dusted off in advance of special movie screenings in major markets this week , is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows .
He was certainly a designer , dreamer and self-identified hippie , but he was also a meticulous organizer and flow-chart tweaker - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from " a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] there 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product . "
Back in 1995 , Bob Cringely was developing the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer , and he sat down for more than an hour with Jobs for a rare , extended conversation .
At that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company NeXT , looking forward to the popular adoption of the Internet .
While a small portion of Cringely 's interview was used in Nerds , he says that the interview 's master copies went missing in shipping .
It was only following Jobs " death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director 's garage .
This footage , slightly re-edited , is the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs : The Lost Interview , coming to Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday .
For someone known to loathe in-depth interviews , Jobs seems surprisingly eager here to expound on his technological philosophies and business strategies .
And incredibly thoughtful .
At four different points during the interview , there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15-second ruminations , where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts , aiming for precision .
There are also moments where Jobs " perfectionism rises to the surface , where he seems impatient about Cringely 's questions , nudging him to move faster towards issues or subplots of greater import .
Filmed before the era of Pixar , the iPod or the iPhone , there 's something eerily prescient about the Lost Interview , as Jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong , and offers his own vision of the future of computing .
It 's one thing to read posthumous appraisals of Jobs " career , but there 's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here , the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness .
He has a vision for the way things could be and should be .
Not long after spelling it all out here he went and did it .
A quick rundown of seven notable Lost Interview sequences :
On how he learned to run a business :
" Throughout the years in business , I 'd always ask : " Why do you do things ? " and the answers you invariably get are : " Oh , that 's just the way it 's done . " "
Nobody knows why they do what they do , nobody thinks about things very deeply in business .
That 's what I found .
Jobs goes on to detail his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple .
Baffled by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a " standard cost " that amounted to a blind guess , which was then adjusted with a " variance " - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .
On pranking the Pope :
Jobs recounts the " Blue Box " that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free .
The device has been widely written about before , but Jobs " euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is infectious .
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one AT &amp; T network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible .
" We were wrapping things around the globe a half dozen times and you would yell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door , " Jobs says with a giggle .
" We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
Us two , we didn 't know much , but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson , and I don 't think there would have ever been Apple without it .
Jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and Wozniak nearly pulled of , ringing the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope , while doing their very best impression of Henry Kissinger .
As various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat , the two burst into giggles just before the Pope himself was roused to come answer the phone .
On falling in love with technology ( and cold-calling Bill Hewlett ) :
At the age of 12 , on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter , he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and gave him a call .
Not long after their 20-minute phone conversation , Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard .
" That made a remarkable influence on me , it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees . "
Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company 's Palo Alto research labs , where he saw " the first desktop computer ever made . "
It was as big as a suitcase , had a small cathode ray tube display , and I fell in love with it .
I would get a ride up to HP as a teenager and hang around that machine and write programs for it .
On improvising innovation :
At several points in the interview , Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly .
Early in his career , as he set out to sell a handful of circuit boards , he was asked by a customer to assemble the full computer .
Working on only 30 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .
Later while at Apple , he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse :
" I remember having dramatic arguments ... they were screaming at me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] , and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer . "
Ninety days later , we had a mouse we could build for $ 15 that was incredibly reliable .
On great companies losing steam :
Long before he led the revival of Apple , Jobs presciently foresaw the ways in which so many industry leaders would stumble in their vision , and lose control of their market share .
" Say you work at IBM or Xerox , so you make a better copier or printer , so what ? "
You have a monopoly of the market share , so the company 's not more successful .
Sales and marketing makes it more successful , so [ it 's those kinds of people ] who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision-making forum .
The product genius that led to that monopolistic position is rotted out by people who have no conception of good products vs. bad products - the craftsmanship required .
That 's what happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry .
It could have been ten times its size , could have been the Microsoft of the 90s ...
They grabbed defeat from victory .
On innovation as art form :
" There 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product ... as you evolve that great idea , it changes and grows . "
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it .
There are tradeoffs you have to make - certain things you can 't make electrons do , glass do , robots do , factories do .
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together ...
Ultimately it comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best stuff humans have done , and then trying to bring those things in to what you 're doing .
Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal .
We 've always been shameless about stealing great ideas .
It 's part of what made the Macintosh great , was that the people who were working on it were musicians , poets , artists , zoologists , historians who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
If not for computer science , they would be doing amazing things in other fields .
EU Ambassadress Vicenová :
Czechs have the reputation of being negative and euro-sceptical
" Lisbon Treaty caused significant imbalance between individual institutions . "
" I did not expect it to be such a tough war . "
" It will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable , calm , and before all players get used to their new roles , " EU Ambassadress Milena Vicenová opened her lecture at the Law Department sharply .
She proved how true she is to her " Clearly and openly about Europe " motto in the very first part of her lecture , where she described individual EU organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelligible , way that many lecturers from the UK Law Dept. could be jealous .
Moreover , Vicenová praised the work of new long-term President of the European Council , Herman Van Rompuy :
" At first , critics said he was plain , a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles ; I have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role . "
" He is a person who can listen to all twenty-seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a clear vision of where the EU should be headed . "
She explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question : " Who is the European Union ? Which phone number should I call ? " ; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of Union 's policy towards countries such as China or India .
No One Wants To Ban Our Cheese Specialties
Vicenová further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU in the past , present , and near future .
She described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success .
Czechs were dealing with the coming financial crisis ; they solved the as crisis ; and organised the East Partnership Summit .
She said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic .
Currently , Czech representatives in the EU has been very busy .
As the ambassadress said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stirring .
In addition , a new seven-year EU budget needs to be passed , which is very complicated due to the current crisis .
Whether the budget will be slim and frugal ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be supported more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .
The ambassadress reminded the key slogans she took to Brussels : " About Europe , Clearly . "
" I really do not like all the abbreviations , foreign words , and jargon no one understands .
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels , people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers , different size bananas , or that someone wants to ban our cheese specialties . '
She also wants to use the EU environment better , and get more Czechs into European institutions .
Multispeed Europe Is Coming
The ambassadress says Czechs are said to be Euro-sceptics ; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things .
She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions .
She thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the Czech side .
Along with the success of Czech presidency , she highlighted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group .
" Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary , and a Slovak is coming to join us , the Frenchman next to me says : " Hey , what 's that gathering about , is that the Visegrad Group again ? ' and he is not happy about it in the slightest . '
In the Union 's future , Vicenová expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states .
Rather than a new European Federation , she finds the concept of two-speed , if not multi-speed Europe , very realistic .
" We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone . "
" We have Schengen area , and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation . "
" For the first time it was said that the countries who want are to cooperate , while those who are not willing can stand off . "
" The number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two-speed Europe , " Vicenová expects .
In this regard , she appreciated the roles of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in pushing forward the rule based on which , all topics influencing the entire EU should be negotiated by all member states , and not just those belonging into the Eurozone .
Mission over , Congress ready to agree on Libya
It finally looks like Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya .
All it took was for the revolt to succeed , longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and American involvement to end .
On Tuesday , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to consider a resolution , sponsored by Chairman John Kerry ( D-Mass . ) , along with Sens. John McCain ( R-Ariz . ) and Joseph I. Lieberman ( I-Conn . ) , applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their " bravery . "
" This resolution is about honoring the courageous people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country , " Kerry said .
" It 's an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations . "
The language may sound innocuous , but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far .
This summer , lawmakers from both parties squabbled with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the U.S. military 's role in the NATO mission in Libya .
In June , Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya .
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin , and it never came up for a vote in the Senate .
But on the same day that bill failed in the House , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for American operations in Libya .
That left the U.S. mission in a form of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama 's handling of the mission but not so angry as to actually pull the rug out from under it .
Then Congress 's indecision was overtaken by events .
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August , and Gaddafi was killed Oct . 20 .
The NATO mission officially ended Oct . 31 .
Now the Senate may be ready to act .
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution " congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in liberating themselves " and " commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who engaged in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism . "
The resolution also " affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya . "
Will the new measure earn the full support of the Foreign Relations panel , or will it split lawmakers like the June bill did ?
The last version was opposed by Sen. Richard G. Lugar ( Ind . ) , the committee 's top Republican .
Lugar 's spokesman said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet .
Across the Capitol , the House is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget , a top legislative priority of nearly every congressional Republican and some Democrats .
The measure , sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R-Va . ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to actually get a floor vote in the House or Senate this Congress .
Other lawmakers have been unsuccessful so far in bringing their amendments to the floor , but not for lack of trying .
Goodlatte 's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this Congress , spanning a wide range of topics .
Some are duplicates - the same bill offered in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations on each other .
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone , and another handful that would " control federal spending . "
Some of those bills are identical too , but they give their sponsors - particularly freshmen Republicans looking to burnish their resumes - the chance to brag that they " authored " such a measure .
The Budget Control Act , which passed in August , required that both the House and Senate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
In March , 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment .
Beyond the budget , several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve , while Rep. José E. Serrano ( D-N.Y. ) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents .
Rep . Jesse L. Jackson Jr . ( D-Ill . ) has offered a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care , among other subjects .
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is a perennial offering , as is one prohibiting flag-burning .
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the nullification of federal laws if they are opposed by two-thirds of the states .
As eager as members have been to offer amendments , they 're not moving at any faster pace than in past years .
In the 111th Congress , lawmakers offered 77 such amendments , and they introduced 66 in the 110th .
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s , when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years , according to numbers provided by the Senate Library .
But they weren 't much more successful then than they are now .
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 , but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789 .
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City .
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness , frustration and loss .
On cue , several hundred soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines strode into position around him .
The black-tie crowd rose to its feet and cheered .
" The servicemen and women were regarded as heroes , " said David Saltzman , who organized the spring fundraiser .
A senior military officer at the gala , also attended by the Joint Chiefs then-chairman , Adm. Mike Mullen , saw the troops " role differently .
" They were rolled out like some sort of orphan kid , " the officer wrote in an e-mail .
I 'm sure the organizers meant well .
I know they did .
But it wasn 't respect , really . It was pity .
The starkly conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant , sometimes adoring American public .
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices .
But the praise comes with a price , service members say .
The public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for those in uniform .
" We aren 't victims at all , " said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland , who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan .
" But it seems that the only way that some can be supportive is to cast us in the role of hapless souls . "
The topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve .
They also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the Vietnam War was far worse .
As a result , most of the conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among combat veterans .
After his two sons returned from combat tours with the Marines , retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives .
Some would look at them with a sense of awe because they faced down insurgents and traveled to exotic places .
Others would wonder whether there was an " angry , violent veteran beneath the surface , " said Cancian , who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government job in Washington .
During his job search , he said , he sensed that some interviewers had subtly inquired whether he would be able to hold up under the strain of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour .
" When you talk about your service , you need to counter the negative impressions , " Cancian recalled telling his sons .
The military 's unease springs , in part , from American indifference to the wars .
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
" We , as a nation , no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II , " said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno , who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Instead , praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member 's suffering .
Troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries .
The Worst Feminine Habits : Do They Concern You ?
When you ask men to name some typical bad habits women have , they usually come up with all of them in an instant .
Dear ladies , do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow , describing several women 's habits that make the men see red ?
Shopping
Does your other half complain you are addicted to shopping ?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week ?
Do you like shopping , in mass sales ?
If so , then your shopping may be seen as bad habit .
Some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping .
Still , who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all ( ideally , in various colour versions ) in the changing rooms ?
Shopping may be a hobby for a majority of women , but for men , it may become absolute hell .
Just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside ...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
" Am I too fat ? "
" I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start doing some exercise ? "
" Are you still attracted to me ? "
Do you find these sentences familiar ?
You do ?
Then , you belong to the group of women obsessed by their appearance .
Not that you should stop looking after yourself , but many men are literary allergic to their partners " constant complaints about their looks .
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints , the more annoying women are .
Order and Cleanliness First
It is like a never ending story .
Cleaning the windows , vacuuming , wiping the floors , dusting , scrubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week .
Do you blame your partner for stepping onto the clean tiles in dirty shoes ; your children for messing up a clean sink and leaving fingerprints over the glass pane in the living room that was so difficult to clean ?
In case you suffer from this " deviation , " try to realise that no extremes are good ; and that within your family , order and cleanliness should not go first .
This harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationships , as well as the entire family .
Bossing About
" Throw the underwear into the bin . "
" Do you plan to wear the dirty socks tomorrow ? "
" Wet dishtowels do not belong on the floor . "
If you boss your partner around several times a day , he may find it very annoying .
Naturally , you mean well , you just want everything to be perfect .
Maybe , if men realised that , women would not have to boss them around so much ...
Gossiping
Some women love gossiping , offending , and plotting against others .
Women are focused on relationships , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why .
Every now and then , probably each of us releases a gossip here or there .
Let 's be frank , this is probably the nature all women .
However , there are tougher gossips , women who enjoy frequent gossiping and despise everyone . They are , especially within a female work team , very dangerous for their surroundings .
